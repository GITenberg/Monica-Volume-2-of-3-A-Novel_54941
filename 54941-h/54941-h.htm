<h2 title="12. MRS. BELLAMY">CHAPTER THE TWELFTH.<br />

<small>MRS. BELLAMY.</small></h2>


<p>Randolph was gone; and Monica, left
alone in her luxurious London house, felt
strangely lost and desolate. Her husband
had expressed a wish that she should go
out as much as possible, and not shut herself
up in solitude during his brief absence,
and to do his will was now her great desire.
She would have preferred to remain quietly
at home. She liked best to sit by her fire
upstairs, and make Wilberforce tell her of
Randolph’s childhood and boyish days; his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>devotion to his widowed mother, his kindness
to herself, all the deeds of youthful
prowess, which an old nurse treasures up
respecting her youthful charges and delights
to repeat in after years. Wilberforce would
talk of Randolph by the hour together if
she were not checked, and Monica felt
singularly little disposition to check her.</p>

<p>However she obeyed her husband in
everything, and took her morning’s ride as
usual next day, and was met by Cecilia
Bellamy, who rode beside her, with her
train of cavaliers in attendance, and pitied
the poor darling child who had been
deserted by her husband.</p>

<p>“I am just in the same sad predicament
myself, Monica,” she said, plaintively.
“My husband has had to go to Paris, all
of a sudden, and I am left alone too. We
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>must console ourselves together. You must
drive with me to-day and come to tea, and
I will come to you to-morrow.”</p>

<p>Monica tried in vain to beg off; Cecilia only
laughed at her. Monica had not <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">savoir faire</i>
enough to parry skilful thrusts, nor insincerity
enough to plead engagements that did
not exist. So she was monopolised by Mrs.
Bellamy in her morning’s ride, was driven
out in her carriage that same afternoon,
and taken to several houses where her
friend had “just a few words” to say to
the hostess. She was taken back to tea,
and had to meet Conrad, who received
her with great warmth, and had the bad
taste to address her by her Christian name
before a whole roomful of company, and
who ended by insisting on walking home
with her. Yet his manner was so quiet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>and courteous, and he seemed so utterly
unconscious of her disfavour, that she was
half ashamed of it, despite her very real
annoyance.</p>

<p>And the worst of it was that there
seemed no end to the attentions pressed
upon her by the indefatigable Cecilia.
Monica did not know how to escape from
the manifold invitations and visits that
were showered upon her. She seemed
fated to be for ever in the society of Mrs.
Bellamy and her friends. Beatrice Wentworth
and her brother were themselves
out of town; Randolph was detained longer
than he had at first anticipated, and Monica
found herself drawn in an imperceptible
way—against which she rebelled in vain—into
quite a new set of people and places.</p>

<p>Monica was a mere baby in Cecilia’s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>hands. She had not the faintest idea of any
malice on the part of her friend. She felt
her attentions oppressive; she disliked the
constant encounters with Conrad; but she
tried in vain to free herself from the
hospitable tyranny of the gay little woman.
She was caught in some inexplicable way,
and without downright rudeness she could
not escape.</p>

<p>As a rule, Conrad was very guarded and
discreet, especially when alone with her.
He often annoyed her by his assumption of
familiarity in presence of others, but he
was humble enough for the most part, and
took no umbrage at her rather pointed
avoidance of him. She did not know what
he was trying to do: how he was planning
a subtle revenge upon his enemy her
husband—the husband she was beginning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>unconsciously yet very truly to love. She
shrank from him without knowing why,
but the day was rapidly approaching when
her eyes were to be opened.</p>

<p>Her instincts were so true that it was
not easy to deceive her for long. Ignorance
of the world and reluctance to suspect evil
blinded her for a time; but she was to
learn the true nature of her so-called
friends before long.</p>

<p>There had been a small picnic party at
Richmond one day. Monica had tried hard
to excuse herself from attending, but had
been laughed and coaxed into consent. It
mattered the less what she did now, for
her husband was to be at home the following
day, and in the gladness of that thought
she could almost enjoy the sunshine, the
fresh air, the sight of green grass and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>waving trees, the country sights and sounds
to which she had so long been a stranger.</p>

<p>The party, too, was small, and though
Conrad was of the number, he held aloof
from Monica, for which she was glad, for
she had felt an increasing distrust of him
of late. It was an equestrian party, and
the long ride was a pleasure to Monica,
who could have spent a whole day in the
saddle without fatigue.</p>

<p>And then her husband was coming. He
would set all right. She would tell him
everything—she had not felt able to do so
in the little brief notes she had written to
him—and she would take his advice for
the future, and decline friendship with all
who could not be his friends too. Everything
would be right when Randolph came
back.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>
<p>Then Monica was glad of an opportunity
of a little quiet talk with Cecilia
Bellamy. The wish for a private interview
with her had been one of the reasons
which had led her to consent to be one
of to-day’s party. She had something
on her mind she wished to say to her in
private, and as yet she had found no
opportunity of doing so.</p>

<p>Yet it was not until quite late in the
afternoon that Monica’s opportunity came;
when it did, she availed herself of it at
once. She and her friend were alone in a
quiet part of the park; nobody was very
near to them.</p>

<p>“Cecilia,” said Monica, “there is something
I wish to say to you now that we are
alone together. I am very much obliged
to you for being so friendly during my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>husband’s absence—but—but—it is difficult
to say what I mean—but I think you ought
not to have had your brother so much with
you when you were asking me; or rather I
think, as he is your brother, whilst I am
only a friend, the best plan would be for
us to agree not to attempt to be very
intimate. We have drifted apart with the
lapse of years, and there are reasons, as
you know, why it is not advisable for me
to see much of your brother. I am sure
you understand me without any more
words.”</p>

<p>“Oh, perfectly!” said Mrs. Bellamy with
a light laugh. “Poor child, what an ogre
he is! Well, at least, we have made the
best of the little time he allowed us.”</p>

<p>Monica drew herself up very straight.</p>

<p>“I do not understand you, Cecilia.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>Please to remember that you are speaking
of my husband.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Bellamy laughed again.</p>

<p>“I am in no danger of forgetting, my
dear. Please do not trouble yourself to
put on such old-fashioned airs with me; as
if every one did not know your secret by
this time.”</p>

<p>Monica turned upon her with flashing
eyes.</p>

<p>“What secret?”</p>

<p>“The secret of your unhappy marriage,
my love. It was obviously a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mariage de
convenance</i> from the first, and you take no
pains to disguise the fact that it will never
be anything else. As Randolph Trevlyn is
rather a fascinating man, there is only one
rational interpretation to be put upon your
persistent indifference.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>
<p>Monica stood as if turned to stone.</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Why, that your heart was given away
before he appeared on the scene. People
like little pathetic romances, and there is
something in the style of your beauty, my
dear, that makes you an object of interest
wherever you go. You are universally
credited with a ‘history’ and a slowly
breaking heart—an equally heart-broken
lover in the background. You can’t think
how interested we all are in you—and——”</p>

<p>But the sentence was not finished. Mrs.
Bellamy’s perceptions were not fine, but
something in Monica’s face deterred her
from permitting her brother’s name to pass
her lips. It was easy to see that no
suspicion of his connection with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>“romance” concocted for her by gossiping
tongues had ever crossed her mind. But
she was sternly indignant, and wounded to
the quick by what she had heard.</p>

<p>She spoke not a word, but turned
haughtily away and sought for solitude in
the loneliest part of the park. She was
terribly humiliated. She knew nothing of
the inevitable chatter and gossip, half
good-humoured, half mischievous, with
which idle people indulge themselves about
their neighbours, especially if that neighbour
happens to be a beautiful woman, with
an unknown past and an apparent trouble
upon her. She did not know that spite on
Conrad’s part, and flighty foolishness on
that of his sister, had started rumours concerning
her. She only felt that she had by
her ingratitude and coolness towards the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>husband who had sacrificed so much for
her, and whom she sincerely respected, and
almost loved, had been the means of bringing
his name and hers within the reach of
malicious tongues, had given rise to cruel
false rumours she hated ever to think of.
If only her husband were with her!—at
least he would soon be with her, and if for
very shame she could not repeat the cruel
words she had heard, at least she could
show to all the world how false and base
they were.</p>

<p>Monica woke up at last to the fact that
it was getting late, and that she was in a
totally strange place, far away from
the rest of the party. She turned
quickly and retraced her steps. She
seldom lost her bearings, and was able to
find her way back without difficulty, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>she had strayed farther than she knew; it
took her some time to reach the glade
in which they had lunched, and when she
arrived there she found it quite deserted.
There was nothing for it but to go back to
the hotel, whither she supposed the others
had preceded her, but when she reached
the courtyard no one was to be seen but
Conrad, who held her horse and his own.</p>

<p>“Ah, Monica! here you are. We
missed you just at starting. Did you lose
yourself in the park? Nobody seemed to
know what had become of you.”</p>

<p>“I suppose I walked rather too far.
Where are the rest?”</p>

<p>“Just started five minutes ago. We
only missed you then. I said I’d wait. We
shall catch them up in two minutes.”</p>

<p>As this was Mrs. Bellamy’s party, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>Conrad was her brother, this mark of
courtesy could not be called excessive, yet
somehow it displeased Monica a good deal.</p>

<p>“Where is my groom?”</p>

<p>Conrad looked round innocently enough.
“I suppose he joined the cavalcade,
stupid fellow! Stablemen are so very
gregarious. Never mind; we shall be up
with them directly.”</p>

<p>And Monica was forced to mount and
ride after the party with Conrad.</p>

<p>But they did not come up with the
others, despite his assurances, and the fact
that they rode very fast for a considerable
time. He professed himself very much
astonished, and declared that they must
have made a stupid blunder, and have gone
by some other road.</p>

<p>“In that case, Sir Conrad,” said Monica,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>“I will dispense with your escort. I am
perfectly well able to take care of myself
alone.”</p>

<p>He read her displeasure in her face and
voice. She had an instinct that she had
been tricked, but it was not a suspicion
she could put into words.</p>

<p>“<em>Sir</em> Conrad!” he repeated, with
gentle reproach. “Have I offended you,
Monica?”</p>

<p>“Sir Conrad, it is time we should understand
one another,” said Monica, turning
her head towards him. “I made you a
sort of promise once—a promise of friendship
I believe it was. I am not certain
that I ever ought to have given it; but
after my marriage with a man you hold as
an enemy, it is impossible that I can look
upon you as a true friend. I do not judge
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>or condemn you, but I do say that we had
better meet as infrequently as possible, and
then as mere acquaintances. You have
strained your right of friendship, as it is,
by the unwarrantable and persistent use of
my Christian name, which you must have
known was not for you to employ now.
We were playfellows in childhood, I know,
but circumstances alter cases, and our
circumstances have greatly changed. It
must be Sir Conrad and Lady Monica
now between you and me, if ever we
meet in future.”</p>

<p>His eyes gleamed with that wild beast
ferocity that lay latent in his nature, but
his voice was well under command.</p>

<p>“Your will is law, Lady Monica. It is
hard on me, but you know best. I will
accept any place that you assign me.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>
<p>She was not disarmed by his humility.</p>

<p>“I assign you no place; and you know
that what I say is not hard. We are not
at Trevlyn now. You know your own
world well; I am only just beginning to
know it. You had no right ever to take
liberties that could give occasion for criticism
or remark.”</p>

<p>He looked keenly at her, but she was
evidently quite unconscious of the game he
had tried to play for the amusement of his
little circle. She only spoke in general terms.</p>

<p>“There was a time, Monica,” he said
gently, “when you cared less what the
world would say.”</p>

<p>“There was a time, Sir Conrad,” she
answered, with quiet dignity, “when I
knew less what the world might say.”</p>

<p>Had Monica had the least suspicion of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>what her companion had tried to make it
say, she would not now have been riding
with him along the darkening streets,
just as carriages were rolling by carrying
people to dinner or to the theatres.</p>

<p>Twice she had imperatively dismissed
him, but he had absolutely declined to
leave her.</p>

<p>“I will not address another word to you
if my presence is distasteful to you,” he
said; “but you are my sister’s guest, and
in the absence of her husband I stand in
the place of your host. I will not leave
you to ride home at this late hour alone.
At the risk of incurring your displeasure I
attend you to your own door.”</p>

<p>Monica did not protest after that, but
she hardly addressed a single word to her
silent companion.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>
<p>As she rode up to her own house she
saw that the door stood open. The groom
was there, with his horse. He was in
earnest converse with a tall, broad-shouldered
man, who held a hunting-whip
in his hand, and appeared about to spring
into the saddle.</p>

<p>Monica’s heart gave a sudden leap.
Who was that other man standing with
his back to her on the pavement? He
turned quickly at the sound of her approach—it
was her husband.</p>

<p>He looked at her and her companion in
perfect silence. Conrad took off his hat,
murmured a few incoherent words, and
rode quickly away. Randolph’s hand
closed like a vice upon his whip, but he
only gave one glance at the retreating
figure, and then turned quietly to his wife
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>and helped her to dismount. The groom
took the horse, and without a word from
anyone, husband and wife passed together
into the house. And this was the meeting
to which Monica had looked forward with
so much trembling joy.</p>

<h2 title="13. RANDOLPH’S STORY">CHAPTER THE THIRTEENTH.<br />

<small>RANDOLPH’S STORY.</small></h2></div>


<p>Randolph led his wife upstairs to the
drawing-room, and closed the door behind
them. It was nine o’clock, and the room
was brightly illuminated. Randolph was
in dinner dress, as though he had been
some time at home. His face was pale,
and wore an expression of stern repression
more intense than anything Monica had
ever seen there before. She was
profoundly agitated—agitated most of all
by the feeling that he was near her again;
the husband that she had pined for without
knowing that she pined. Her agitation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>was due to a kind of tumultuous joy more
than to any other feeling, but she hardly
knew this herself, and no one else would
have credited it, from the whiteness of her
face, and the strained look it wore. As a
matter of fact, she was physically and
mentally exhausted. She had gone through
a great deal that day; she had eaten little,
and that many hours ago; she was a good
deal prostrated, though hardly aware of it—a
state in which nervous tension made
her unusually susceptible of impression;
and she trembled and shrank before the
displeasure in her husband’s proud face.
Would he look like that if he really loved
her? Ah, no! no! She shrank a little
more into herself.</p>

<p>Randolph did not hurry her. He took
off his overcoat leisurely, and laid his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>whip down upon the table. He looked
once or twice at her as she sat pale and
wan in the arm-chair whither he had led
her. Then he came and stood before her.</p>

<p>“Monica, what have you to say to
me?”</p>

<p>She looked up at him with an expression
in her dark eyes that moved and touched
him. Something of the severity passed
from his face; he sat down, too, and laid
his hand upon hers.</p>

<p>“You poor innocent child,” he said
quietly, “I do not even believe you know
that you have done wrong.”</p>

<p>“I do, Randolph,” she answered. “I do
know, but not as you think—I could not
help that. I hated it—I hate him; but to-night
I could not help myself. Where I
was wrong was in not doing as you asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>—persisting
in judging for myself. But how
could I know that people could be so cruel,
so unworthy, so false? Randolph, I should
like to-night to know that I should never
see one of them again!”</p>

<p>She spoke with a passionate energy that
startled him. He had never seen her
excited like this before.</p>

<p>“What have they been saying to you?”
he asked in surprise.</p>

<p>“Ah! don’t ask me. It is too hateful!
It was Cecilia. She seemed to think it was
amusing—a capital joke. Ah! how can
people be so unwomanly, so debased!”</p>

<p>She put her hands before her eyes, as if
to shut out some hideous image. “Yes,
I will tell you, Randolph—I will. I owe it
to you, because—because—oh, because
there is just enough truth to make it so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>terribly bitter. She said that people knew
it was not an ordinary marriage, ours—she
called it a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mariage de convenance</i>. She
said everybody knew we had not fallen in
love with one another.” Monica’s hand
was still pressed over her eyes; she could
not look at her husband. “She said I
showed it plainly, that I let every one see.
I never meant to, Randolph, but perhaps I
did. I don’t know how to pretend. But
oh, she said people thought it was because
I cared—for some one else—that I had
married you whilst I loved some one else—and
that is all a wicked, wicked lie!
You believe that, Randolph, do you not?”</p>

<p>She rose up suddenly and he rose too,
and they stood looking into each other’s
eyes.</p>

<p>“You believe that at least, Randolph?”
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>she asked, and wondered at the stern
sorrow visible in every line of his face.</p>

<p>“Yes, Monica, I believe that,” he
answered, very quietly; yet, in spite of all
his yearning tenderness there was still some
sternness in his manner, for he was deeply
moved, and knew that the time had come
when at all costs he must speak out. “I,
too, have heard that false rumour, and have
heard—which I hope you have not—the
name of the man to whom your heart is
supposed to be given. Shall I tell it you?
His name is Conrad Fitzgerald.”</p>

<p>Monica recoiled as if he had struck her,
and put both her hands before her face.
Randolph continued speaking in the same
concise way.</p>

<p>“Let me tell you my tale now, Monica.
I left Scotland early this morning, finishing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>business twelve hours earlier than I
expected. I wired from Durham to you;
but you had left the house before my
telegram reached. In the train, during
the last hour of the journey, some young
fellows got in, who were amusing themselves
by idle repetition of current gossip.
I heard my wife’s name mentioned more
than once, coupled with that of Sir Conrad
Fitzgerald, in whose company she had
evidently been frequently seen of late. I
reached home—Lady Monica was out for
the day with Mrs. Bellamy—presumably
with Sir Conrad also. I dined at my club,
to hear from more than one source that the
world was gossiping about my handsome
wife and Sir Conrad Fitzgerald. I came
home at dusk to find the groom just
returned, with the news that Sir Conrad
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>was bringing my lady home, that he was
dismissed from attendance; and in effect
the man whose acquaintance I repudiate,
whose presence in my house is an insult,
rides up to my door in attendance upon
my wife. Before I say any more, tell me
your story. Monica, let me hear what
you have been doing whilst I have been
away.”</p>

<p>Monica, roused to a passionate indignation
by what she heard—an indignation
that for the moment seemed to include the
husband, who had uttered such cruel,
wounding words, told her story with
graphic energy. She was grateful to
Randolph for listening so calmly and so
patiently. She was vaguely aware that not
all men would show such forbearance and
self-control. She knew she had wounded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>him to the quick by her indiscretion and
self-will, but he gave her every chance to
exculpate herself. When she had told her
story, she stood up very straight before
him. Let him pronounce sentence upon
her; she would bear it patiently if she
could.</p>

<p>“I see, Monica,” he answered, very
quietly, “I understand. It is not all your
fault. You have only been unguarded.
You have been an innocent victim. It is
Fitzgerald’s own false tongue that has set
on foot these idle, baseless rumours. It is
just like him.”</p>

<p>Monica recoiled again.</p>

<p>“Just like him! but, Randolph, he is
my friend!”</p>

<p>A stern look settled upon Randolph’s
face.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>
<p>“Oblige me, Monica, by withdrawing
that word. He is <em>not</em> your friend; and he
is my enemy.”</p>

<p>“Your enemy?”</p>

<p>“Yes; and <em>this</em> is how he tries to obtain
his revenge.”</p>

<p>Monica was trembling in every limb.</p>

<p>“I do not understand,” she said.</p>

<p>“Sit down, then, and I will tell you.”</p>

<p>She obeyed, but he did not sit down.
He stood with his back against the
chimney-piece, the light from the chandelier
falling full upon his stern resolute face,
with its handsome features and luminous
dark eyes.</p>

<p>“You say you know the story of
Fitzgerald’s past?”</p>

<p>“Yes; he forged a cheque. His sister
told me.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>
<p>Randolph looked at her intently.</p>

<p>“Was that <em>all</em> she told you?”</p>

<p>“Yes; she said it was all. He deceived
a friend and benefactor, and committed a
crime. Was not that enough?”</p>

<p>“Not enough for Fitzgerald, it seemed,”
answered Randolph, significantly. “Monica,
I am glad you did not know more, since you
have met that man as a friend. Forgiveness
is beautiful and noble—but there are
limits. I will tell you the whole story, but
in brief. The Colonel Hamilton of whom
you heard in connection with the forgery
was Fitzgerald’s best and kindest friend.
He was a friend of my mother’s and of
mine. I knew him intimately, and saw a
good deal of his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">protégé</i> at his house and at
Oxford. I did not trust him at any time.
It was no very great surprise when, after a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>carefully concealed course of vulgar
dissipation, he ended by disgracing himself
in the way you have heard described. It
cut Hamilton to the quick. ‘Why did not
the lad come to me if he was in trouble?
I would have helped him,’ he said. He
let me into the secret, for I happened to be
staying with him at the time; but it was
all hushed up. Fitzgerald was forgiven,
and vowed an eternal gratitude, as well
as a complete reformation in his life.”</p>

<p>“Did he keep his promise?” asked
Monica in a whisper.</p>

<p>“You shall hear how,” answered Randolph,
with a gathering sternness in
his tone not lost upon Monica. “From
that moment it seemed as if a demon
possessed him. I believe—it is the only
excuse or explanation to be offered—that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>there is a taint of insanity in his blood,
and that with him it takes, or took, the
form of an inexplicable hatred towards the
man to whom he owed so much. About
this time, Colonel Hamilton, till then a
bachelor, married a friendless, beautiful
young wife, to whom in his very quiet and
undemonstrative way he was deeply and
passionately attached, as she was to him.
But she was very young and very inexperienced,
and when that man, with his
smooth false tongue, set himself to poison
her life by filling her mind with doubts of
her husband’s love, he succeeded but too
well. She spoke no word of what she
suffered, but withdrew herself in her morbid
jealous distress. She broke the faithful
heart that loved her, and she broke her own
too. It sounds a wild and foolish tale, perhaps,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>to one who does not understand the
mysteries of a passionate love such as that;
but it is all too true. I had been absent
from England for some time, but came
home, all unconscious of what had happened,
to find my friend Hamilton in terrible grief.
His young wife lay dying—dying of a rapid
decline, brought on, it was said, by mental
distress; and worse than all, she could not endure
her husband’s presence in the room, but
shrank from him with inconceivable terror
and excitement. He was utterly broken
down by distress. He begged me to see
her, and to learn if I could, the cause of
this miserable alteration. I did see her.
I did get her to tell her story. I heard
what Conrad Fitzgerald had done; and
I was able, I am thankful to say, to
relieve her mind of its terrible fear, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>to bring her husband to her before the
end had come. She died in his arms,
happy at the last; but she died; and
he, in his broken-hearted misery for her
loss, and for the treachery of one he
had loved almost as a son, did not survive
her for long. Within six months,
my true, brave friend followed her to the
grave.</p>

<p>“I was with him to the end. I need
hardly say that Fitzgerald did not attempt
to come near him. He was plunged in a
round of riotous dissipation. Upon the day
following the funeral, I chanced to come
upon him, surrounded by a select following
of his boon companions. Can I bring
myself to tell you what he was saying
before he knew that I was within earshot?
I need not repeat his words, Monica: they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>are not fit for your ears. Suffice it to say
that he was passing brutal jests upon the
man who had just been laid in his grave,
and upon the young wife whose heart had
been broken by his own base and cruel
slanders. Coupled with these jests were
disgraceful boastings, as unmanly and false
as the lips that uttered them.</p>

<p>“I had in my hand a heavy riding-whip.
I took him by the collar, and I made him
recant each one of those cruel slanders he
had uttered, and confess himself a liar and
a villain. I administered, then and there,
such a chastisement as I hope never to
have to administer to any man again. No
one interposed between us. I think even
his chosen companions felt that he was receiving
no more than his due. I thrashed
him like the miserable hound he was. If it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>had been possible, I would have called him
out and shot him like a dog.”</p>

<p>Randolph’s voice had not risen whilst he
was speaking. He was very calm and composed
as he told his story; there was no
excitement in his manner, and yet his quiet,
quivering wrath thrilled Monica more than
the fiercest invective could have done.</p>

<p>“My whip broke at last. I flung him
from me, and he lay writhing on the floor.
But he was not past speech, and he had
energy left still to curse me to my face, and
to vow upon me a terrible vengeance, which
should follow me all my life. He is trying
now to keep this vow. History repeats
itself you know. He ruined the happiness
of one life, and brought about this tragedy,
by poisoning the mind of a wife, and setting
her against her husband; and I presume
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>he thinks that experiment was successful
enough to be worth repeating. There,
Monica, I have said my say. You have
now before you a circumstantial history of
the past life of Sir Conrad Fitzgerald—your
friend.”</p>

<h2 title="14. STORM AND CALM">CHAPTER THE FOURTEENTH.<br />

<small>STORM AND CALM.</small></h2></div>


<p>Monica sat with her face buried in her
hands, her whole frame quivering with
emotion. Those last words of her husband’s
smote her almost like a blow. She
deserved them, no doubt; yet they were
cruel, coming like that. He could not
have spoken so if he loved her. He would
not stand coldly aloof whilst she suffered, if
he held her really dear. And yet, once he
had almost seemed to love her, till she had
alienated him by her pride and self-will. It
was just, she admitted, yet, oh! it was
very hard!</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>
<p>She sat, crushed and confounded, for a
time, and it was only by a great effort that
she spoke at all.</p>

<p>“I did not know, Randolph; I did not
know. You should have told me before.”</p>

<p>“I believed you did know. You told me
that you did.”</p>

<p>“Not that. Did you think I could know
<em>that</em> and treat him as a friend? Oh, Randolph!
how could you? You ought to
have told me before.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I ought,” he said. “But
remember, Monica, I spoke out very
plainly, and still you insisted that he was,
and should continue to be, your friend—your
repentant friend.”</p>

<p>Monica raised her eyes to her husband’s
face, full of a sort of mute reproach. She
felt that she merited the rebuke—that he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>might have said much more without being
really harsh—and yet it was very hard, in
this hour of their re-union, to have to hear,
from lips that had never uttered till then
anything but words of gentleness and love,
these reproofs and strictures on her conduct.
She saw that he was moved: that
there was a repressed agitation and excitement
in his whole manner; but she
could not guess how deeply he had been
roused and stirred by the careless jests
he had heard passed that day, nor how
burning an indignation he felt towards
the man who had plotted to ruin his
happiness.</p>

<p>“You should not have left me, Randolph,”
said Monica, “if you could not
trust me.”</p>

<p>He went up to her quietly, and took her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>hands. She stood up, looking straight into
his eyes.</p>

<p>“I did trust you—I do trust you,” he
answered, with subdued impetuosity. “Can
I look into your face and harbour one
doubt of your goodness and truth? I trust
<em>you</em> implicitly; it is your judgment, not
your heart, that has been at fault.”</p>

<p>She looked up gratefully, and drew one
step nearer.</p>

<p>“And now that you have come back, all
will be right again,” she said. “Randolph,
I will never speak to that man again.”</p>

<p>His face was stern; it wore a look she
did not understand.</p>

<p>“I am not sure of that,” he answered,
speaking with peculiar incisiveness. “It
may be best that you <em>should</em> speak to him
again.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>
<p>She looked up, bewildered.</p>

<p>“Randolph, why do you say that?
Do you think that, after all, he has repented?”</p>

<p>Randolph’s face expressed an unutterable
scorn. She read the meaning of that
glance, and answered it as if it had been
expressed in words.</p>

<p>“Randolph, do you believe for a moment
that I would permit any one to speak ill
of you to me? Am I not your wife?”</p>

<p>His face softened as he looked at her,
but there was a good deal of sadness there,
too.</p>

<p>“I do not believe you would deliberately
listen to such words from him; but are
not poisoned shafts launched sometimes
that strike home and rankle? Has no
one ever come between you and me, since
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>the day you gave yourself to me in
marriage?”</p>

<p>He saw her hesitation, and a great sadness
came into his eyes. How near she
was and yet how far! His heart ached
for her in her loneliness and isolation, and
it ached for himself too.</p>

<p>Monica broke the silence first.</p>

<p>“Randolph,” she said timidly; “no
harm has been done to you, really? He
cannot hurt you; can he?”</p>

<p>His face was stern as he answered her.</p>

<p>“He will hurt me if he can—through
my wife. His threat is still unfulfilled;
but he knows where to plant a blow, how
to strike in the dark. Yes, Monica, he has
hurt me.”</p>

<p>She drew back a pace.</p>

<p>“How?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>
<p>“It hurts me to know that idle gossip
connects my wife’s name with his—that he
has the credit of being a lover, discarded
only from motives of policy. I know that
there is not a syllable of truth in these
reports—that they have been set afloat by
his malicious tongue. Nevertheless, they
hurt me. They hurt me the more because
my wife has given some countenance to
such rumours, by permitting a certain
amount of intimacy with a man whom
her husband will not receive.”</p>

<p>Monica was white to the lips. She
understood now, as she had never done
before, what Cecilia Bellamy had meant by
her flighty speeches a few hours before.
They had disgusted and offended her then,
now they appeared like absolute insults.
Randolph saw the stricken look upon her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>face, and knew that she was cut to the
quick.</p>

<p>“Monica,” he said, more gently, “what
has been done can be undone by a little
patience and self-control. We need not
be afraid of a man like Sir Conrad. I have
known him and his ways long. He has
tried before to injure me without success.
He has tried in a more subtle way this time;
yet again I say, most emphatically, that he
has failed.”</p>

<p>But Monica hardly heard. She was torn
by the tumult of her shame and distress.</p>

<p>“Randolph!” she exclaimed, stretching
out her hands towards him: “Randolph,
take me home! oh! take me home, out of
this cruel, cruel, wicked world! I cannot
live here. It kills me; it stifles the very
life out of me! I am so miserable, so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>desolate here! It is all so hard, and so
terrible! Take me home! Ah! I was
happy once!”</p>

<p>“I will take you to Trevlyn, Monica,
believe me, as soon as ever I can; but
it cannot be just yet. Shall I tell you
why?”</p>

<p>She recoiled from him once more, putting
up her hand with that instinctive gesture of
distress.</p>

<p>“You are very cruel to me Randolph,”
she said, with the sharpness of keen misery
in her voice.</p>

<p>He stood quite still, looking at her,
and then continued in the same quiet
way:</p>

<p>“Shall I tell you why? I cannot take
you away until we have been seen together
as before. I shall go with you to some of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>those houses you have visited without me.
We must be seen riding and driving,
and going about as if nothing whatever
had occurred during my absence. If we
meet Fitzgerald, there must be nothing in
your manner or in mine to indicate that
he is otherwise than absolutely indifferent
to us. I dare say he will put himself in
your way. He would like to force upon
me the part of the jealous, distrustful
husband, but it is a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rôle</i> I decline to play
at his bidding. I am not jealous, nor am
I distrustful, and he and all the world
shall see that this is so. If I take you
away now, Monica, I shall give occasion
for people to say that I am afraid to trust
my wife in any place where she may meet
Fitzgerald. Let us stay where we are, and
ignore the foolish rumours he has circulated,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>and we shall soon see them drop into
deserved oblivion.”</p>

<p>“Randolph, I cannot! I cannot!” cried
Monica, who was now overwrought and
agitated to the verge of exhaustion; “I
<em>cannot</em> stay here. I cannot go amongst
those who have dared to say such things,
to believe such things of me. What does
it matter what they think, when we are
far away? Take me back to Trevlyn, and
let us forget it all. Let me go, if only
for a week. I have never asked you
anything before. Oh! Randolph, do not
be so hard! Say that you will take me
home!”</p>

<p>“If I loved you less, Monica,” he
answered, in a very low, gentle tone, “I
should say yes. As it is, I say no. I
cannot take you to Trevlyn yet.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>
<p>She turned away then, and left him
without a word, passing slowly through
the brilliantly-lighted room, and up the
wide staircase. Randolph sat down and
rested his head upon his hand, and a long-drawn
sigh rose up from the very depths
of his heart. This interview had tried him
quite as much as it had done Monica—possibly
even more.</p>

<p>“Perhaps, after all, Fitzgerald <em>has</em>
revenged himself,” he muttered, “though
not in a way he anticipated. Ah, Monica!
my fair young wife, why cannot you trust
me a little more?”</p>

<p>Monica trusted him far more than he
knew. It was not in anger that she had left
him. In the depth of her heart she believed
that he had judged wisely and well; it was
only the wave of home-sickness sweeping
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>over her that had urged her to such
passionate pleading. And then his strong,
inflexible firmness gave her a curious sense
of rest and confidence. She herself was so
torn and rent by conflicting emotions, by
bewilderment and uncertainty, that his
resolute determination and singleness of
purpose were as a rock and tower of
defence. She had called him cruel in the
keen disappointment of the moment, but
she knew he was not really so. Home-sick,
aching for Trevlyn as she was—irrepressibly
as she shrank from the idea of facing those
to whom she had given cause to say that
she did not love her husband, she felt that
his decision was right. It might be hard,
but it was necessary, and she would go
through her part unflinchingly for his sake.
It was the least that she could do to make
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>amends for the unconscious wrong she had
done him.</p>

<p>She felt humbled to the very dust,
utterly distrustful of herself, and quite
unworthy of the gentleness and forbearance
her husband showed towards her.
How much he must be disappointed in her!
How hard he must feel it to have married
her out of kindness, and to be treated
thus!</p>

<p>She was very quiet and submissive
during the days that followed, doing everything
he suggested, studying in all things
to please him, and to make up for the past.
In society she was more bright and less
silent than she had been heretofore. She
was determined not to appear unhappy.
No one should in future have cause to
say that her present life was not congenial
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>to her. Certainly, if anyone took the
trouble to watch her now, it would easily
be seen that she was no longer indifferent
to her husband. Her eyes often followed
him about when he was absent from her
side. She always seemed to know where
he was, and to turn to him with a sort of
instinctive welcome when he came back
to her. This clinging to him was quite
unconscious, the natural result of her confidence
in his strength and protecting care;
but it was visible to one pair of keenly
jealous eyes, and Conrad Fitzgerald, when
he occasionally found himself in company
with Randolph and his wife, watched with
a sense of baffled malevolence the failure of
his carefully-planned scheme.</p>

<p>People began to talk now of the devotion
of Mr. Trevlyn and Lady Monica with as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>much readiness and carelessness as they
had done about their visible estrangement.
It takes very little to set idle tongues
wagging, and every one admired the bride
and liked the bridegroom, so that the good
opinion of the world was not difficult to
regain.</p>

<p>But Monica’s peace of mind was less
easily recovered. At home she was grave
and sad, and he thought her cold; and the
full and entire reconciliation—of which, indeed,
at that time she would have felt quite
unworthy—was not to be yet. Each was
conscious of deep love on his or her own
side, but could not read the heart of the
other, and feared to break the existing
calm by any attempt to ruffle the surface of
the waters.</p>

<p>They were not very much alone, for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>Lord Haddon and his sister spent many
evenings with them when they were not
otherwise engaged, and the intimacy between
the two houses increased rapidly.</p>

<p>Monica had never again alluded to the
prospective return to Trevlyn—the half-promise
made by Randolph to take her
back soon. She did not know what
“soon” might mean, and she did not ask.
She had grown content now to leave that
question in his hands.</p>

<p>Once, when in the after-dinner twilight,
she had been talking to Beatrice of her old
home, the latter said, with eager vehemence:</p>

<p>“How you must long to see it again!
How you must ache to be out of this
tumult, and back with your beloved sea
and cliffs and pine-woods! Don’t you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>hate our noisy, busy London? Don’t you
pine to go back?”</p>

<p>Monica was silent, pondering, as it
seemed. She was thinking deeply. When
she answered out of the fulness of her
heart, her words startled even herself.</p>

<p>“I don’t think I do. I missed the quiet
and rest at first, but, you see, my husband
is here; I do not pine when I have him.”</p>

<p>Beatrice’s eyes grew suddenly wistful.
“Ah, no!” she answered. “I can understand
that.”</p>

<p>But after a long silence she rallied herself
and asked:</p>

<p>“But is he not going to take you back?
Do you not want to see your father and
brother again?”</p>

<p>“Yes, if Randolph is willing to take me;
but it must be as he likes.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>
<p>“He will like what will please you
best.”</p>

<p>Monica smiled a little.</p>

<p>“No; he will like what is best, and I
shall like it too.”</p>

<p>Beatrice studied her face intently.</p>

<p>“Do you know, Monica, that you have
changed since I saw you first?”</p>

<p>Monica passed her hand across her brow.
What a long time it seemed since that first
meeting in the park!</p>

<p>“Have I?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Do you know I used to have a
silly fancy that you did not much care for
Randolph? It was absurd and impertinent,
I know; but Haddon had brought
such a strange account of your sudden
wedding, called you the ‘snow bride,’ and
had somehow got an idea that it had all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>been rather cold and sad—forgetting, of
course, that the sadness was on account of
your father’s health. I suppose I got a
preconceived idea; and do you know,
when first I knew you I used to think of
you as the ‘snow-bride,’ and fancy you
very cold to everyone—especially to Randolph;
and now that I see more of you
and know you better, it is just as plain
that you love him with all your heart and
soul.”</p>

<p>Monica sat quite still in the darkness,
turning about the ring upon her finger—the
pledge of his wedded love. She was
startled at hearing put into plain words the
secret thought treasured deep down in her
heart, but seldom looked into or analysed.
Had it come to that? Did she indeed
love him thus? Was that the reason
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>she yielded up herself and her future
so trustfully and willingly to him?—the
reason that she no longer yearned after
Trevlyn as home, so long as he was
at her side? Yes, that was surely it.
Beatrice had spoken no more than the
truth in what she said. She did love her
husband heart and soul; but did he love
her too? There lay the sting—she had
proved unworthy of him: he must know
it and feel it. She had been near to winning
his heart; but alas! she had not won
it—and now, now perhaps it was too late.
And yet the full truth was like a ray of
sunshine in her heart. Might she not yet
win his love by the depth and tenderness
of her own? Something deep down within
her said that the land of promise lay, after
all, not so very far away.</p>

<div class="chapter"><h2 title="15. A SUMMONS TO TREVLYN">CHAPTER THE FIFTEENTH.<br />

<small>A SUMMONS TO TREVLYN.</small></h2></div>


<p>“Randolph! Randolph! Why did you
not take me home when I begged so hard
to go? It was cruel! cruel! And now it
is too late!”</p>

<p>This irrepressible cry of anguish burst
from Monica in the first moments of a
terrible, overmastering grief. An open
telegram in Randolph’s hand announced
the sudden death of Lord Trevlyn. He
had just broken to his wife, with as much
gentleness as he could, the news of this
crushing sorrow. It was hardly unnatural
that she should remember, in such a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>moment, how eloquently she had pleaded a
few weeks back to be taken home to
Trevlyn, yet she repented the words before
they had passed her lips, for she saw they
had hurt her husband.</p>

<p>He was deeply grieved for her, his heart
yearned over her, but his words were
few.</p>

<p>“Can you be ready to start, Monica, by
the noon express?”</p>

<p>She bent her head in a silent assent,
and moved away as one who walks in a
dream.</p>

<p>“Poor child!” he said softly, “poor
child! If only my love could make up to
you for what you have lost; but alas! that
is not what you want.”</p>

<p>It was a strange, sad, silent journey,
almost as sad as the one in which Randolph
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>had brought his bride to London. He was
taking her back at last to her childhood’s
home. Was he any nearer to her innermost
self than he had been that day, now
nearly three months ago?</p>

<p>He was hopeful that he had made an
advance, and yet this sudden recall to
Trevlyn disconcerted him. Apart from the
question of the earl’s death, there was
another trouble, he believed, hanging over
Monica’s future. Tom Pendrill had been
profiting by her absence to “experiment,”
as she would have called it, upon Arthur,
with results that had surprised even him,
though he had always believed the case
curable if properly treated. Randolph had
had nothing to do directly with the
matter, but Tom had written lately, asking
him to find out the best authorities on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>spinal injuries, and get some one or two
specialists to come and have a look at
the boy. This Randolph had done at his
own expense, and with the result, as he
had heard a few days back, that Arthur
was to be sent abroad for a year, to be
under a German doctor, whose cures of
similar cases had been bringing him into
marked repute.</p>

<p>Monica had been, by Arthur’s special
wish, kept in ignorance of everything. He
was eagerly anxious, even at the cost of
considerable suffering, to submit to the
prescribed treatment, feeling how much
good he had already received from Tom’s
more severe remedies; but he knew how
Monica shrank from the idea of anything
that could give him pain, how terrible she
would consider the idea of parting, how
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>vehemently she would struggle to thwart
the proposed plan. So he had begged that
she might be kept in ignorance till all was
finally settled. Indeed, he had some idea,
not entirely discouraged by Tom, of
getting himself quietly removed to Germany
in her absence, so that she might be
spared all the anxiety, misery, and
suspense.</p>

<p>Randolph could hardly have been
acquitted of participation in the scheme,
the whole cost of which was to fall upon
him, and he wondered what Monica might
think of his share in it. It had been no
doing of his that she had not been told
from the first. He had urged upon the
others the unfairness of keeping her in the
dark; but Arthur’s vehement wish for
secrecy had won the day, and he had held
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>his peace until he should be permitted to
speak.</p>

<p>And now, what would happen? What
was likely to be the result upon Monica of
the inevitable disclosure? Would it not
seem to her as if the first act of her
husband, on succeeding to the family estate,
was to banish from it the one being for
whom she had so often bespoken his
protection and brotherly care? Might she
not fancy that he was in some way the
originator of the scheme? Might she not
be acute enough to see that but for him it
never could have been carried out, owing
to lack of necessary funds? Her father
might have approved it, but he could
not have forwarded it as Randolph was
able to do. Might it not seem to her that
he was trying to rid himself of an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>unwelcome burden, and to isolate his wife
from all whom she loved best? He could
not forget some of the words she had
spoken not very long after their marriage.
Practically those words had been rescinded
by what had followed, but that could
hardly be so in this case. Monica’s heart
clung round Arthur with a passionate,
yearning tenderness, that was one of the
main-springs of her existence. What would
she say to those who had banded together
to take the boy from her?</p>

<p>Randolph’s pre-occupation and gravity
were not lost upon Monica, but she had no
clue to their real cause. She felt that
there was something in it of which she was
ignorant, and there was a sort of sadness
and constraint even in the suspicion of
such a thing. She was unnerved and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>miserable, and, although, she well knew
she had not merited her husband’s full
confidence, it hurt her keenly to feel that it
was withheld from her.</p>

<p>Evening came on, a wild, melancholy
stormy evening—is there anything more
sad and dreary than a midsummer storm?
It does not come with the wild, resistless
might of a winter tempest, sweeping
triumphantly along, carrying all before it
in the exuberance of its power. It is a
sad, subdued, moaning creature, full of
eerie sounds of wailing and regret, not
wrapped in darkness, but cloaked in misty
twilight, grey and ghostlike—a pale,
sorrowful, mysterious thing, that seems to
know itself altogether out of place, and
is haunted by its own melancholy and
dreariness.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>
<p>It was in the fast waning light of such a
summer’s evening that the portals of
Trevlyn opened to welcome Monica again.</p>

<p>She was in the old familiar hall that once
had been so dear to her—the place whose
stern, grim desolation had held such charms
for her. Why did she now gaze round her
with dilated eyes, a sort of horror growing
upon her? Why did she cling to her
husband’s arm so closely, as the frowning
suits of mail and black carved faces stared
at her out of the dusky darkness? Why
was her first exclamation one of terror and
dismay?</p>

<p>“Randolph! Randolph! This is not
Trevlyn! It cannot be Trevlyn! Take me
home! ah, take me home!”</p>

<p>There was a catch in her breath; she
was shaken with nervous agitation and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>exhaustion. It seemed to her that this
ghostly place was altogether strange and
terrible. She did not know that the change
was in herself; she thought it was in her
surroundings.</p>

<p>“What have they done to it? What
have they done to Trevlyn? This is not
my old home!”</p>

<p>Randolph took her in his arms, alarmed
by her pale looks and manifest disquietude.</p>

<p>“Not know your own old home, Monica?”
he said, half gravely, half playfully. “This
is the only Trevlyn I have ever known.
It is you that have half forgotten, you
have grown used to something so very
different.”</p>

<p>Monica looked timidly about her, half
convinced, yet not relieved of all her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>haunting fears. What a strange, vast,
silent place it was! Voices echoed
strangely in it, resounding as it were from
remote corners. Footsteps sounded hollow
and strange as they came and went along
the deserted passages. The staircase
stretched upwards into blank darkness,
suggesting lurking horrors. All was
intensely desolate. Was this truly the
home she had loved so well?</p>

<p>But Lady Diana appeared from one
direction, and Tom Pendrill from another.
Monica dropped her husband’s arm and
stood up, her calm, quiet self again.</p>

<p>Food was awaiting the travellers, and
as they partook, or tried to partake of it,
they heard all such particulars of the earl’s
sudden death as there were to hear. He
had been as well as usual; indeed, during
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>the past week he had really appeared to
gain in strength and activity. He had
been out of doors on all fine days, and only
yesterday had sat out for quite a long time
upon the terrace. He had gone to bed
apparently in his usual health; but when
his man had gone to him in the morning
he found him dead and cold. Tom
Pendrill had come over at once, and had
remained for the day, relieving Lady Diana
from all trouble in looking after things,
and thinking what was to be done. It was
his opinion that the earl had died in his
sleep, without a moment’s premonition.
It was syncope of the heart, and was most
likely almost instantaneous. There had
been no struggle and no pain, as was
evident from his restful attitude and
expression.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>
<p>The next days passed sadly and heavily,
and the earl was laid to rest amongst his
forefathers in the family vault. Lady
Diana took her departure, glad, after the
strain and sorrow of the past days, to
escape from surroundings so gloomy, and
to solace herself for her long stay at
Trevlyn, by a retreat to an atmosphere
more congenial to her.</p>

<p>Monica was glad to see her go. She
shrank from her sharp words and sharper
looks. She longed to be alone with her
husband, that she might try to win back
his heart by her own deep love that she
hid away so well.</p>

<p>But it was not easy even then to say
what was in her heart. Randolph was
busy from morning till night over the
necessary business that must ensue upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>the death of a landed proprietor. Tom
Pendrill, who had been much with the
earl of late, remained to assist his successor;
and both the men seemed to take it for
granted that Monica would gladly be
spared all business discussions, and devote
herself to Arthur, from whom she had so
long been separated.</p>

<p>Monica, very gentle and submissive,
accepted the office bestowed upon her, and
quietly bided her time. Despite the loss
she had just sustained, she was not
unhappy. How could she be unhappy
when she had her husband? when she felt
that every day they were drawing nearer
and nearer together? She looked wistfully
into his face sometimes, and saw the old
proud, tender look shining upon her,
thrilling her with wonderful gladness.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>Some little shadow still hung over them,
but it was rolling slowly away—the dawn
was breaking in its golden glory—the time
was drawing very near when each was to
know the heart of the other wholly and
entirely won.</p>

<p>She never shrank from hearing the new
Lord Trevlyn called by his title; but looked
at him proudly and tenderly, feeling how
well he bore the dignity, how nobly he
would fulfil the duties now devolving upon
him. She watched him day by day with
quiet, loving solicitude. She saw his care
for her in each act or plan, knew that he
thought for her still, made her his
first object, although she had disappointed
him so grievously once. Her heart
throbbed with joy to feel that this was so;
the sunshine deepened round her path day
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>by day. Just a little patience—just a
little time to show him that the old distrust
and insubordination were over, and
he would give to her—she felt sure of it
now—the love she prized above all else
on earth.</p>

<p>Monica’s face might be pale and grave
in these days, yet it wore an added sweetness
as each passed by, for her heart was
full of strange new joy. She loved her
husband—he loved her—their hearts were
all but united.</p>

</div>

<p>“Arthur!”</p>

<p>“Aha! my lady! you did not expect
that, did you? Now look here!”</p>

<p>Arthur, who was sitting up in an arm-chair—a
thing Monica had never seen him
do since that terrible fall from the cliffs
years ago—now pulled himself slowly into
a standing position, and by the help of a
stout stick, shuffled a few paces to his
couch, upon which he sank breathless,
yet triumphant, though his drawn brow
betrayed that the achievement was made
at the cost of some physical pain.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>
<p>“Arthur, don’t! You will kill yourself!”</p>

<p>“On the contrary, I am going to cure
myself—or rather, Tom and his scientific
friends are going to cure me,” answered
Arthur, panting a little with the exertion,
but very gay and confident. “Do you
know, Monica, that for the last three
months I have been at Tom’s tender
mercies, and you see what I can do at the
end of that time? Randolph paid no end
of money, I believe, to send down two big
swells from London to overhaul me; and
now—now what do you think is going to
happen?”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“The day after to-morrow I am going to
start for Germany—for a place where there
are mineral springs and things; and I am
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>going to stay there for a year, with a doctor
who has cured people worse than me.
Randolph is going to pay—isn’t he just
awfully good? And in a year, Monica,
I shall come back to you well—cured!
What do you think of that? Haven’t we
kept our secret well? Why, Monica,
don’t look like that! Aren’t you pleased
to think that I shall not be always a
cripple?”</p>

<p>But Monica was too utterly astounded
to be able to realise all at once what this
meant.</p>

<p>“Arthur, I don’t understand,” she said
at length. “You seeing doctors—you
going to Germany! Whose doing is it
all?”</p>

<p>“Whose? Randolph’s practically, I suppose,
since he finds the money for it.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>
<p>“Why was not I told?”</p>

<p>“That was my doing. I felt that if
you knew you would dissuade me. But
you can’t now, for in two days I shall be
gone!”</p>

<p>“Was Randolph willing to keep a secret
from me—about you?” asked Monica,
slowly.</p>

<p>“No, he didn’t like it. He wanted you
to be told; but I wouldn’t have it, and he
gave in. I wanted to tell you myself when
everything was fixed. Can you believe I
am really going?”</p>

<p>“No, I can’t. Do you want to go, Arthur—to
leave Trevlyn?”</p>

<p>“I want to get well,” he answered,
eagerly. “If you had been lying on your
back for years, Monica, you would understand.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>
<p>“I do understand,” answered Monica,
clasping her hands. “Only—only——”</p>

<p>“Oh! yes, I know all that. It won’t
be pleasant. But I’d do more for a good
chance of getting well. So now it’s all
settled, and I’m off the day after to-morrow!”</p>

<p>“You’ve not given me much time for
my preparations.”</p>

<p>Arthur laughed outright.</p>

<p>“Oh, you’re not going—did you think
you were? Why, you’re Lady Trevlyn
now—a full-blown countess. It would be
too absurd, your tying yourself to me.
Besides”—with a touch of manly gravity
and purpose—“I wouldn’t have you,
Monica, not at any price. I can stand
things myself, but I can’t stand the look
in your eyes. Besides, you know, it would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>be absurd now—quite absurd. You’re
married, you know, and that changes
everything.”</p>

<p>Monica’s face was hard to read.</p>

<p>“I should have thought that, even
married, I might have been allowed to see
you placed safely in the hands of this new
doctor, after having been almost your only
nurse all these years.”</p>

<p>He stretched out his hand and drew her
towards him, making her kneel down
beside him, so that he could gaze right
into her face.</p>

<p>“You must not look like that, you
sweet, sensitive, silly sister,” said Arthur,
caressingly. “You must not think I have
changed, because I wish to go away, and
because I will not have you with me. I
love you the same as ever. I know that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>you love me, and if you want a proof of
this you shall have it, for I am going to
ask a favour of you—a very great
favour.”</p>

<p>Monica smoothed his hair with her
hand.</p>

<p>“A favour, Arthur?—Something that I
can grant? You know you have only to
ask.”</p>

<p>“I want you to lend me Randolph,” he
said, with a little laugh, as if amused at
the form of words he had chosen. “I
want to know if you can spare him for the
journey. Tom is going to take me, but
somehow, Tom—well, he is very clever and
kind, but he does hurt me, there’s no denying,
and I don’t feel quite resigned to be
entirely at his mercy. But Randolph is
different. He is so very strong, he moves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>me twice as easily, and he is so awfully
kind and gentle: he stops in a moment if
he thinks it hurts. He has been here a
good bit with Tom since he got back, and
you can’t think how different his handling
is. I don’t like to take him away from
you. You must miss him so awfully: he
is such a splendid fellow!”</p>

<p>“Have you said anything to Randolph
about it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no. I couldn’t till I’d asked you.
I do feel horrid to suggest such a thing;
but you’ve made me selfish, you know, by
spoiling me. It will take us three days
to go; but he could come back much
quicker. Tom is going to stop on for a
bit, to study cures with this old fogey; so
I shall have somebody with me. I’ll not
keep Randolph a day after I get landed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>there, but I should like him for the
journey uncommonly.”</p>

<p>Monica stooped and kissed him. “I
will arrange that for you,” she said,
quietly, and went away without another
word.</p>

<p>She went slowly downstairs to the study,
where her husband was generally to be
found. She was dazed and confused by
the astounding piece of news she had
heard: hurt, pleased, hopeful, grieved,
anxious, and half indignant all in one.
Her indignation was all for Tom Pendrill,
whom she had always regarded, where
Arthur was concerned, something in the
light of a natural foe. For her husband’s
quiet generosity and goodness she had
nothing but the warmest gratitude. He
would not be led away by professional
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>enthusiasm, or wish to inflict suffering upon
Arthur just for the sake of scientific
inquiry. He would not wish to send him
from Trevlyn unless he believed that some
great benefit would result from that
banishment.</p>

<p>She smiled proudly as she thought of
Conrad’s old prediction fulfilling itself so
exactly now. Once she would have felt
this deed of his as a crushing blow, aimed
at the very foundation of her love and
happiness; now she only saw in it a new
proof of her husband’s single-minded love
and strength. He would do even that
which he knew would cause present pain,
if he felt assured it were best to do so. He
had proved his strength like this before,
and she knew that he had been in the right.
Should she distrust him now? Never
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>again! never again! She had done with
distrust now. She loved him too truly to
feel a shadow of doubt. Whatever he did
must be true and right. She would find
him now, and thank him for his goodness
towards her boy.</p>

<p>She went straight to the study, full of
this idea. Her eyes were shining
strangely; her face showed that her feelings
had been deeply stirred. But when she
opened the door, she paused with a start
expressive of slight discomfiture, for her
husband was not alone—Tom Pendrill was
with him. They had guide-books and a
Continental Bradshaw open before them,
and were deep in discussions and plans.</p>

<p>They looked up quickly as Monica
appeared, and Randolph, seeing by her
face that she knew all, nerved himself to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>meet displeasure and misunderstanding.
Monica could not say now what she had
rehearsed on the way. Tom was there,
and she was not sure that she quite forgave
him, although she believed he acted
from motives of kindness; but certainly
she could not speak out before him. The
words she had come prepared to utter died
away on her lips, and her silence and whole
attitude looked significant of deep-lying
distress and displeasure.</p>

<p>“You have heard the news, Monica?”
said Tom, easily.</p>

<p>“Yes, I have heard the news,” she
answered, very quietly. “Is it true that you
take him away the day after to-morrow?”</p>

<p>“Quite true,” answered Tom, looking
very steadily at her. “Do you forgive us,
Monica?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>
<p>She was silent for a moment; sort of
quiver passed over her face.</p>

<p>“I am not quite sure if I forgive <em>you</em>,”
she answered in a low even tone.</p>

<p>She had not looked at her husband all
this time, nor attempted to speak to him.
She was labouring visibly under the stress
of subdued emotion. Randolph believed he
knew only too well the struggle that was
going on within her.</p>

<p>“Monica,” he said—and his voice
sounded almost cold in his effort to keep
it thoroughly under control—“I am afraid
this has been a shock to you. I am sure
you will feel it very much. Will you try
to believe that we are acting as we believe
for the best as regards Arthur’s future,
and pardon the mystery that has surrounded
our proceedings?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>
<p>Monica gave him one quick look—so
quick and transient that he could not
catch the secret it revealed. She spoke
very quietly.</p>

<p>“Everything has been settled, and I
must accept the judgment of others.
Results alone can quite reconcile me to
the idea; but at least I have learned to
know that I do not always judge best
in difficult questions. Arthur wishes to
go, and I will not stand in his way.
There is only one thing that I want to
ask,” and she looked straight at her
husband.</p>

<p>“What is that, Monica?”</p>

<p>“I want you to go with him,
Randolph.”</p>

<p>“You want me to go with him?”</p>

<p>“Yes, to settle him in his new quarters,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>and to come and tell me all about it, and
how he has borne the journey. Tom will
not be back for weeks—and I don’t know
if I quite trust Tom’s truthfulness. Will
you go too, Randolph? I shall be happier
if I know he is in your keeping as well.”</p>

<p>He looked at her earnestly. Did she
wish to get rid of him for a time? Was
his presence distasteful to her after this last
act of his? He could not tell, but his
heart was heavy as he gave the required
assent.</p>

<p>“I will do as you wish, Monica. If you
do not mind being a few days alone at
Trevlyn, I will go with Arthur. It is the
least I can do, I suppose, after taking him
away from you.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Randolph,” she said, with
one more of those inexplicable glances.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>“I need not be alone at Trevlyn. Aunt
Elizabeth will come, I am sure, and stay
with me;” and she went quietly away
without another word.</p>

<p>“I say, Trevlyn, you have tamed my
lady pretty considerably,” remarked Tom,
when the men were alone together. “I
expected no end of a shine when she found
out, and she yields the point like a lamb.
Seems to me you’ve cast a pretty good spell
over her during the short time you’ve had
her in hand.”</p>

<p>Randolph pulled thoughtfully at his
moustache as he turned again to the papers
on the table. He did not reply directly to
Tom’s remark, but presently observed,
rather as if it were the outcome of his own
thoughts:</p>

<p>“All the same, I would give a good
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>deal if one of my first acts after coming
into the property were not to banish
Arthur from Trevlyn for a considerable
and indeterminate time.”</p>

<p>“Oh, bosh!” ejaculated Tom, taking
up Bradshaw again. “Why, even Monica
would never put a construction like that
upon this business.”</p>

<p>This day and the next flew by as if on
wings. There was so much to think of,
so much to do, and Monica had Arthur so
much upon her mind, that she found
no opportunity to say to Randolph what
she had purposed doing in the heat
of the moment. Speech was still an
effort to her; her reserve was too deep
to be easily overcome. She was busy
and he was pre-occupied. When he returned
she would tell him all, and thank
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>him for his generous goodness towards her
boy.</p>

<p>“Monica,” said Arthur, as she came to
bid him good-night upon the eve of his
journey—he had had a soothing draught
administered, and was no longer excited,
but quiet and drowsy—“Monica, you will
be quite happy, will you not, with only
Randolph now? You love him very much,
don’t you?”</p>

<p>She bent her head and kissed him.</p>

<p>“Yes, Arthur,” she answered, softly.
“I love him with all my heart.”</p>

<p>“Just as he loves you,” murmured
Arthur. “I can see it in his face, in
every tone of his voice, especially when he
talks of you—which is pretty nearly always—we
both like it so much. I am so glad
you feel just the same. I thought you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>did. I shall like to think about you so—how
happy you will be!”</p>

<p>The next day after Arthur had been
placed in the carriage that was to take
him away from Trevlyn, and Monica had
said her last adieu to him, and had turned
away with pale face and quivering lips,
she felt her hands taken in her husband’s
strong warm clasp.</p>

<p>“Monica,” he said tenderly, “good-bye.
I will take every care of him. You shall
hear everything, and shall not regret, if I
can help it, trusting him to me.”</p>

<p>Monica looked up suddenly into his face,
and put her arms about his neck. She
did not care at that moment for the
presence of Tom or of the servants. Her
husband was leaving her—she had only
thoughts for him.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>
<p>“Take care of yourself, Randolph,” she
said, her voice quivering, and almost
breaking. “Take care of yourself, and
come back to me as quickly as you can.
I shall miss you, oh! so much, till I have
you safe home again. Good-bye, dear
husband, good-bye!”</p>

<p>He held her for a moment in his arms.
His heart beat tumultuously; for an
instant everything seemed to recede, and
leave him and his wife alone in the world
together; but it was no time now to
indulge in raptures. He kissed her
brow and lips, and gently unloosed her
clasp.</p>

<p>“Good-bye, my wife,” he said gently.
“God bless and keep you always.”</p>

<p>The next moment the carriage was
rolling rapidly away along the road,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>Monica gazing after it, her soul in her
eyes.</p>

<p>“Ah; my darling,” said Mrs. Pendrill,
coming and taking her by the hand, “it
is very hard to part with him; but it was
kind to Arthur to spare him, and it is only
for a few days.”</p>

<p>“I know, I know,” answered Monica
passing her hand across her eyes. “I
would not have kept him here. Arthur
wanted him so much—I can understand so
well what he felt—it would have been
selfish to hold him back. But it feels so
lonely and desolate without him; as if
everything were changed and different. I
can’t express it; but oh! I do feel it all so
keenly.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Pendrill pressed the hand she
held.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>
<p>“You love him, then, so very much?”</p>

<p>“Ah, yes,” she answered; “how could
I help it?”</p>

<p>“It makes me very happy to hear you
say that. For I was sometimes rather
afraid that you were hurried into marriage
before you had learned to know your own
heart, I thought.”</p>

<p>Monica passed her hand across her
brow.</p>

<p>“Was I hurried?” she asked dreamily.
“It is so hard to remember all that now.
It seems as if I had always loved Randolph—as
if he had always been the centre of
my life.”</p>

<p>And Mrs. Pendrill was content. She
said no more, asked no more questions.</p>

<p>“You know, Randolph,” said Arthur to
his kindest of nurses and attendants, as he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>lay in bed at night, after rather a hard
day’s travelling, “I don’t wonder now that
you’ve so completely cut me out. I
shouldn’t have believed it possible once,
but it seems not only possible, but natural
enough, now that I know what kind of a
fellow you are.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean, my boy?” asked
Randolph.</p>

<p>“Mean? Why, what I say to be sure.
I understand now why you’ve so completely
cut me out with Monica. I only
hold quite a subordinate place in her
affections now. It is quite right, and I
shall never be jealous of you, old fellow;
only mind you always let me be her
brother. I can’t give up that. You may
have all the rest, though. You deserve it,
and you’ve got it too, by her own showing.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>
<p>Randolph started a little involuntarily.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Mean? why, that she loves you heart
and soul, of course. You must know it as
well as I, and I had it from her own
lips.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“My wife, my wife!” said Randolph, as
he paced beneath the starry heavens that
night. “Then I was not deceived or mistaken—my
wife—my Monica—my very
own—God bless you, my darling, and
bring me safe home to you and to your
love!”</p>

<h2 title="17. UNITED">CHAPTER THE SEVENTEENTH.<br />

<small>UNITED.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>During the days that followed Monica
lived as in one long, happy dream. The
clouds all seemed to have rolled away,
letting in the sunshine to the innermost
recesses of her heart.</p>

<p>Why was she so calmly and serenely
happy, despite the real sorrow hanging
over her in the recent death of a tenderly-loved
father? Why did even the loss of
the brother, to whom she had vowed such
changeless devotion, give her no special
pang? She had felt his going much, yet it
did not weigh her down with any load of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>sorrow. She well knew why these changes
were. The old love had not changed nor
waned, but it had been eclipsed in the light
of the deep wonderful happiness that had
grown up in her heart, since she had come to
know how well and faithfully she loved
Randolph, and to believe at last in his love
for her.</p>

<p>Yes, she no longer doubted that now.
Something in the very perfectness of her
own love drove away the haunting doubts
and fears that had troubled her for so
long. He had her heart, and she had
his, and when once she had him
home again the last shadow would have
vanished away. How her heart beat
as she pictured that meeting! How
she counted the hours till she had him
back!</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>
<p>Only once was she disturbed in her quiet,
dreamy time of waiting.</p>

<p>Once, as she was riding through the loneliest
part of the lonely pine wood, Conrad
Fitzgerald suddenly stood in her path,
gazing earnestly at her with a look she
could not fathom.</p>

<p>Her face flushed and paled. She regarded
him with a glance of haughty
displeasure.</p>

<p>“Let me pass, Sir Conrad.”</p>

<p>He did not move; he was still fixedly
regarding her.</p>

<p>“I told you how it would be, Monica,”
he said. “I told you Arthur would be
sent away.”</p>

<p>She smiled a smile he did not understand.</p>

<p>“Let me pass,” she said again.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>
<p>His eyes began to glow dangerously.
Her beauty and her scorn drove him to a
sort of fury.</p>

<p>“Is this the way you keep your
promise? Is this how you treat a man
you have promised to call your friend?”</p>

<p>“My friend!” Monica repeated the words
very slowly, with an inflection the meaning
of which could not be misunderstood; nor
did he affect to misunderstand her.</p>

<p>“Lady Monica,” he said, “you have
heard some lying story, I perceive, trumped
up by that scoundrel you call your
husband.”</p>

<p>He was forced to spring on one side
then, for Monica had urged her horse
forward, regardless of his presence, and
the flash in her eye made him recoil
for a moment; but he was wild with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>rage, and sprang at her horse, catching him
by the bridle.</p>

<p>“You shall hear me!” he cried. “You
shall, I say! You have heard his story,
now hear mine. He has brought false
reports. I know him of old. He is my
enemy. He has poisoned others against
me before now. Lady Monica, upon my
word of honour——”</p>

<p>“<em>Your honour!</em>”</p>

<p>That was all. Indeed, there was no
more to be said. Even Conrad felt that,
and his grasp upon the reins relaxed.
Monica was not in the least afraid of him.
She looked him steadily over as she moved
quietly onward, without the least haste or
flurry. Her quiet courage, her lofty scorn
of him, stung him to madness.</p>

<p>“Very good, Lady Monica—I beg your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>pardon—Lady Trevlyn, I should say now.
Very good. We understand each other
excellently well. You have made a
promise, only to break it—I will show you
how a vow <em>can</em> be kept. I, too, have
made a vow in my time. I make another
now. I have vowed to ruin the happiness
and prosperity of Randolph Trevlyn’s life;
now I will do more. I will destroy your
peace and happiness also!”</p>

<p>He was following Monica as he spoke,
and there was a deep, steady malevolence
in every tone of his voice, and in each
word that he uttered, which gave something
of sinister significance to threats that
might well have been mere idle bravado.
Monica paid not the slightest heed. She
rode on as if she did not even hear; but
she wished she had her husband beside her.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>She was not afraid for herself, only for
him; and in his absence it was easy to be
haunted by vague, yet terrible, fears.</p>

<p>But days sped by; news from Germany was
good. Randolph’s task was accomplished,
and he was on his way home; nay, he
would be there almost as soon as the letter
which announced him. He did not specify
exactly how he would come, but he bid
her look for him about dusk that very
day.</p>

<p>How her heart throbbed with joy! She
could not strenuously combat Mrs. Pendrill’s
determination to return home at
once, so that husband and wife should be
alone on his return. She wanted Randolph
all to herself. She hungered for
him; she hardly knew how to wait for the
slowly crawling hours to pass.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>
<p>She drove Mrs. Pendrill to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Maws,
and on her return wandered aimlessly
about the great lonely house, saying to
herself, in a sort of ceaseless cadence:</p>

<p>“He is coming. He is coming. He is
coming.”</p>

<p>Dusk was falling in the dim house. The
shadows were growing black in the gloomy
hall, where Monica was restlessly pacing.
The last pale gleam of sunlight flickered
and faded as she watched and waited with
intense expectancy.</p>

<p>A man’s firm step upon the terrace
without—a man’s tall shadow across the
threshold. Monica sprang forward with a
low cry.</p>

<p>“Randolph!”</p>

<p>“Not exactly that, Lady Trevlyn!”</p>

<p>She stopped short, and threw up her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>head like some beautiful wild creature at
bay.</p>

<p>“Sir Conrad, how <em>dare</em> you! Leave my
husband’s house this instant! Do you wish
him to find you here? Do you wish a
second chastisement at his hands?”</p>

<p>Conrad’s face flushed crimson, darkening
with the intensity of his rage, as he heard
those last words.</p>

<p>He had been drinking deeply; his usual
caution and cowardice were merged in a
passionate desire for revenge at all costs.
And what better revenge could he enjoy at
that moment than to be surprised by the
master of the house upon his return in
company with his wife? Monica had
asked him if he wished Randolph to find
him there—it was just that wish which had
brought him.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>
<p>“Monica!” he cried passionately, “you
shall hear me. I will be heard! You
shall not judge me till I can plead my own
cause. The veriest criminal is heard in his
defence.”</p>

<p>He advanced a step nearer, but she
recoiled before him, and pointed to the
door.</p>

<p>“Go, Sir Conrad, unless you wish to
be expelled by my servants. I will listen
to nothing.”</p>

<p>She moved as if to summon assistance,
but he sprang forward and seized her
hand, holding her wrist in so fierce a
grasp that she could neither free herself
nor reach the bell. She was a prisoner at
his mercy.</p>

<p>But Monica was a true Trevlyn, and a
stranger to mere physical fear. The madness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>in his gleaming eyes, the ferocity of
his whole aspect, were sufficiently alarming.
She knew in this vast place that it
would be in vain to call for help, no one
would hear her voice; but she faced her
enemy with cool, inflexible courage, trusting
to her own strong will, and the
inherent cowardice of a man who could thus
insult a woman alone in her husband’s
house.</p>

<p>“Loose me, Sir Conrad!” she said.</p>

<p>“Not until you have heard me.”</p>

<p>“I will not hear you. I know as much
of your story as there is any need I should.
Loose me, I say! Do you know that my
husband will be here immediately? Do
you wish <em>him</em> to expel you from his
house?”</p>

<p>Conrad laughed wildly, a sort of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>demoniac laugh, that made her shudder
in spite of herself. Was he mad? Yes,
mad with drink and with fury—not
irresponsible, yet so blind, so crazed, so
possessed with thoughts of vengeance, that
he was almost more dangerous than a
raving maniac would have been. His eyes
glowed with sullen fire. His voice was
hoarse and strained.</p>

<p>“Do I wish him to find me here? Yes,
I do—I do!” he laughed wildly. “Kiss
me, Monica—call me your friend again!
There is yet time—show him you are not
his slave—show him how you assert yourself
in his absence.”</p>

<p>Monica recoiled with a cry of horror;
but the strength of madness was upon
him. He held her fast by the wrist. It
was unspeakably hideous to be alone
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>in that dim place with this terrible
madman.</p>

<p>“Monica, I love you—you shall—you
must be mine!”</p>

<p>Was that another step without? It was—it
was! Thank Heaven he had come!</p>

<p>“Randolph! Randolph! Randolph!”</p>

<p>Monica’s voice rang out with that
sudden piercing clearness that bespeaks
terror and distress.</p>

<p>The next moment Conrad was hurled
backwards, with a force that sent him
staggering against the wall, breathless and
powerless. Before he could recover himself
he was lifted bodily off his feet, shaken
like a rat, and literally thrown down the
terrace steps, rolling over and over in the
descent, till he lay at the foot stunned,
bruised and shaken. He picked himself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>slowly up, muttering curses as he limped
away. Little were his curses heeded by
the two he had left behind.</p>

<p>Monica, white, trembling, unnerved by
all she had gone through during the past
minutes, held out her arms to her husband.</p>

<p>“Randolph! Oh, Randolph!”</p>

<p>He clasped her close to his heart, and
held her there as if he never meant to let
her go. He bent his head over her,
and she felt his kisses on her cheek. He
did not doubt—he did not distrust her!
His strong arms pressed her even closer
and closer. She lay against his breast,
feeling no wish ever to leave that shelter.
Oh, he was so true and noble—her own
loving, faithful husband! How she loved
him she had never known until that
supreme moment.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>
<p>At last she stirred in his arms and lifted
her face to his.</p>

<p>“Randolph, you must never leave me
again,” she said. “I cannot bear it—I
cannot.”</p>

<p>“I will not, my dear wife,” he answered.
“Never again shall aught but death part
thee and me.”</p>

<p>She clung to him, half shuddering.</p>

<p>“Ah! do not talk of death, Randolph.
I cannot bear it—I cannot listen.”</p>

<p>He pressed a kiss upon her trembling
lips.</p>

<p>“Does my wife love me now?” he
asked, very gravely and tenderly. “Let
me hear it from your own sweet lips, my
Monica.”</p>

<p>“Ah, Randolph, I love, I love you;” she
lifted her eyes to his as she spoke. There
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>was something almost solemn in their deep,
earnest gaze. “Randolph, I do not think
any one but your wife could know such a
love as mine.”</p>

<p>“Not your husband?” he asked, returning
her look with one equally full of
meaning. “Monica, you may love as well,
but I think you cannot love more than I
do.”</p>

<p>She laid her head down again. It was
unspeakably sweet to hear him say so, to
feel his arms about her, to know that they
were united at last, and that nothing could
part them now.</p>

<p>“Not even death,” said Monica to
herself; “for love like ours is stronger
than death.”</p>

<p>“How came that scoundrel here?”
asked Randolph, somewhat later as they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>stood together on the terrace, watching
the moonlight on the sea.</p>

<p>“I think he came to frighten me—perhaps
to try and hurt us once more by his
wicked words and deeds. Randolph, is
he mad? He looked so dreadful to-day.
He was not the old Conrad I once knew.
It was terrible—till you came.”</p>

<p>“I believe at times he is mad,” answered
Randolph, “with a sort of madness that
is not actual insanity, though somewhat
akin to it. It is the madness of ungovernable
passion and hatred that rises up in
him from time to time against certain
individuals, and becomes, as it seems, a
sort of monomania with him. It was so
with his friend and benefactor Colonel
Hamilton, when once he felt himself found
out. Ever since the horsewhipping I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>administered to him, I believe he has
felt vindictively towards me. Our paths
led us wide apart for several years, but as
soon as we met again the old enmity rose
up once more. He tried to hurt me
through my wife.” Randolph looked down
at her with a proud smile upon his handsome
face. “I need not say how utterly
and miserably he has failed.”</p>

<p>Monica glanced up at him, a world of
loving confidence in her eyes; yet the
clinging clasp of her hands tightened upon
his arm. He fancied she trembled a little.</p>

<p>“What is it, my Monica?”</p>

<p>She pressed a little more closely towards
him.</p>

<p>“Randolph, do you think he will try
to hurt you now—try to do you some
injury?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>
<p>The husband smiled re-assuringly at her.</p>

<p>“Hurt me? How, Monica?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know; but he has spoken
such cruel, wicked words. He said he
had vowed to ruin our happiness—he
looked as if he meant it—so vindictive, so
terrible!” she shivered a little.</p>

<p>He took her hands, and held them in his
warm, strong clasp.</p>

<p>“Are you afraid of what that bad man
says, Monica—a man who is a coward
and a scoundrel of the deepest dye?
Are you afraid of idle threats from his
lips? How could he ruin our happiness
now?”</p>

<p>She looked up at him, still with a sort
of undefined trouble in her eyes.</p>

<p>“He might hurt you, Randolph,” she
half whispered. “What hurts you, hurts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>me. If—if—he were to take you away
from me——”</p>

<p>Randolph laid his hand smilingly upon
her lips.</p>

<p>“My darling, you are unnerved by the
fright he gave you. When was Monica
troubled by idle fears before?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what I fear, Randolph;
but I have feelings sometimes—premonitions,
presentiments, and I cannot shake
them off. Ever since Conrad came, I felt
a kind of horror of him, even though I
tried to call him friend. Sometimes I think
it must mean something.”</p>

<p>“No doubt it does,” answered Randolph.
“It is the natural shrinking of your pure
soul from his evil, vicious nature. I can
well understand it. It could hardly be
otherwise. He could not deceive you long.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>
<p>She looked gravely out before her.</p>

<p>“No, I do not think he really deceived
me long—not my innermost self of all.
But I was very self-willed. I wanted to
judge for myself, and I could not judge
him rightly. I believed him. I did not
want to be unjust—and he deceived me.”</p>

<p>Randolph smiled and laid his hand
caressingly upon her shoulder. She looked
up with a smile.</p>

<p>“That is right, Monica. You must put
away these sad, wistful looks. We must
not let this evening’s happiness be marred
by any doubts and fears. You have your
husband again. Is not that enough?”</p>

<p>She turned and laid her head against his
shoulder. His arm was fast about her in a
moment. She drew a long breath, almost
like a sigh.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>
<p>“Randolph, I think that moments like
this must be a foretaste of heaven.”</p>

<p>He kissed her, and she added, low and
dreamily:</p>

<p>“Only there, there will be no fear of
parting. Death could not part us there.”</p>

<p>“Death could not sunder our hearts
even here, my Monica,” said Randolph.
“Some love is for eternity.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she answered, looking out over
the wide sea with a deep smile, that
seemed as if it were reading the future in
the vast, heaving expanse of moon-lit water.
“Our love is like that—not for time alone,
but for eternity.”</p>

<p>He caught the gravity of her mood.
Some subtle sympathy drew them ever
closer and more close together.</p>

<p>“And so,” he added gravely and tenderly,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>“we need fear nothing; for nothing
can alter that one great thing. Nothing
can change our love. We belong to one
another always—always.”</p>

<p>She stood very still and quiet.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said, “for ever and ever.
Randolph, if we could both die to-night
I think it would be a happy thing for us.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Because then there would be no parting
to fear.”</p>

<p>“And now?”</p>

<p>“Now I do fear it. I fear it without
knowing why. <em>He</em> will part us if he
can.”</p>

<p>Randolph strained his wife close to his
heart.</p>

<p>“<em>If</em> he can! Monica, look up; put
away these idle fears, my love. Can I not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>take care of you and of myself? Let us
put him for ever out of our lives.”</p>

<p>“Ah! if only we could!” breathed
Monica.</p>

<small>A SHADOW.</small></h2></div>


<p>The days that followed were very full of
happiness and peace for Monica and her
husband. They were alone together in
the dim old castle, far away from the busy
whirl of life they had so gladly left behind,
free to be with each other every moment
of the flying hours, learning to know and
to love one another with a more perfect
comprehending love with each succeeding
day.</p>

<p>Not one tiny cloud of reserve or distrust
clouded the sunshine of their horizon.
Monica had laid before Randolph that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>unlucky letter of Lady Diana’s, had
listened with a sort of mingling of
delight and indignation to his comments
on the composition—delight to hear that
he had always loved her from the first,
that in gratifying her father’s desire he
had but been gratifying the dearest desire
of his own heart—indignation towards the
mischief-making relative, who had tried to
deceive and humiliate her, who had told
her one half of the story and concealed the
other.</p>

<p>But indignation was only a momentary
feeling. Monica was too happy to cherish
resentment. Her anger was but a passing
spark.</p>

<p>“I should like to speak my mind to
Lady Diana,” remarked Randolph, as he
tore the paper into small fragments and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>tossed them over the cliff. “I always
distrusted her wisdom, but I did not look
for deliberate malice like that. Why
did you not show me that letter when it
came, Monica, and let me see what I had
to say to it?”</p>

<p>She looked up with a smile.</p>

<p>“Because I was so foolish and distrustful
in those days. I did long to once,
but then came the thought—Suppose it
should be true?”</p>

<p>And then they both smiled. There was
a charm and sweetness in thus discussing
the past, with the light of the happy present
shining upon it.</p>

<p>“But she meant to be your friend,
Randolph. We must not forget that. I
suppose she thought that you would tell
me of your love, but that she ought to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>inform me of your generosity. Poor Aunt
Diana! we should get on better now. In
those days, Randolph, I think I was very
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">difficile</i>—very wilful and unapproachable.
I used to think it would kill me ever to
leave Trevlyn. I think now that it would
have been the ruin of me to stay. It is
not good to grow up in one narrow groove,
and to gain no knowledge of anything
beyond.”</p>

<p>“That is quite true, Monica. Does
that mean that you will be willing to leave
Trevlyn, by and-bye?”</p>

<p>“I shall be willing to do anything that
you wish, Randolph. You know I would
go anywhere with you. Do you want to
take me away again?”</p>

<p>“Presently I think I do. I should like
to take you to Scotland in August, to stay
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>a month or two at my little shooting-box
there. You would like the free, roving
life you could lead there, amongst that
world of heather. And then there are
things to be done at Trevlyn. Monica,
will you be able to reconcile yourself to
changes here?”</p>

<p>“Changes?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I should like to see Trevlyn
restored to what it must have been a
century ago. The glory has departed of
late years, but you have only to look round
to see what the place must have been once.
I want to restore that faded glory—not to
introduce glaring changes, but to make it
something like what it must have been when
our ancestors lived there long years ago.
Would you like that, Monica? It would
not go against you, would it, to see
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>Trevlyn look so? I want it to be
worthy of the mistress who will preside
there. It is a wish that has haunted me
ever since I entered its precincts and met
you there.”</p>

<p>Monica was glad to enter into any plan
proposed by her husband. She was willing
he should restore Trevlyn in any way that
he wished; but she preferred that he
should make his own arrangements about
it, and let her only judge by the result.
She could not yet enter with any sense of
realisation into projects for making Trevlyn
other than she had known it all her life;
but she trusted Randolph’s taste and
judgment, and let him plan and settle
everything as he would.</p>

<p>She was ready to leave home whenever
he wished it, the more so that Conrad
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>Fitzgerald still occupied a suite of rooms
in his half dismantled house, and hung
about the neighbourhood in an odd, aimless
sort of fashion.</p>

<p>How he spent his time no one seemed
to know, but he must have developed
roving tendencies, for Monica was constantly
seeing him in unexpected places,
down by the rocky shore, wandering over
the trackless downs, or crouching in the
heather or behind a tree, as she and her
husband passed along in their daily walks
or rides.</p>

<p>He never met them face to face. He
appeared to endeavour always to keep out
of sight. Randolph, as a matter of fact,
seldom saw him, and paid no heed, when
he did, to the vindictive scowl upon the
yet beautiful face. But Monica seemed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>haunted by this persistent watching and
waiting. She was ever on the look-out for
the crouching figure in some place of
concealment, for the glitter of the fierce
blue eyes, and the cruel sneer of the pale
lips. She felt intensely nervous and
timid beneath that sense of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">espionage</i>; and
she was glad when August came, and
she was to leave Trevlyn and its spectre
behind.</p>

<p>Accounts from Germany were very
good. Arthur wrote little pencil notes
every week, informing Monica that he
was getting on “like a house on fire,” and
singing the praises of Tom, who had stayed
so long with him, “like the good fellow
he was,” and would have remained longer
only it really wasn’t worth while.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I’ve been very unjust to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>Tom,” said Monica. “I want to tell him
so when he comes back. May we wait till
he does? I want to hear all about Arthur
at first hand, as I may not go to see him
yet.”</p>

<p>So they waited for the return of the
traveller.</p>

<p>Monica did sincerely wish to hear about
Arthur, but she had something else to report
to Tom as well. She had the greatest
confidence in his acuteness and penetration,
and could sometimes say to him what she
would have despaired of communicating
intelligibly to any one else.</p>

<p>There was no difficulty in securing a
private interview when once he had come
back. Every one knew how anxious
Monica would be to hear every detail of
Arthur’s present life, and Tom resigned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>himself, and told his tale with all possible
fulness and accuracy.</p>

<p>Monica listened with an absorbed look
upon her face. When he had told all, she
said simply:</p>

<p>“Thank you, Tom, for all your goodness
to him. I am very sorry I ever misunderstood
you, and said such hard things of
and to you. You have got the best of it
in the end, by heaping coals of fire upon
me.”</p>

<p>He smiled slightly.</p>

<p>“My dear Monica, you don’t suppose I
troubled my head over your ladyship’s
righteous wrath. I found it very amusing,
I assure you.”</p>

<p>“I believe you did,” assented Monica,
smiling in turn; “which made things a
little trying for me. Tom, I believe you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>have always been my friend, even when
we have seemed most bitterly opposed.”</p>

<p>The sudden earnestness of her manner
made him look at her keenly, and he
spoke without his usual half-mocking intonation.</p>

<p>“I hope so, Monica. I wish to have the
right to call myself your friend.”</p>

<p>He looked steadily at her, knowing there
was more to follow. She was silent for a
time, and then came a sudden and most
unexpected question, and one apparently
most irrelevant.</p>

<p>“Do you know Sir Conrad Fitzgerald?”</p>

<p>“I used to know him when he was a
child. I knew him slightly at Oxford.
He has made no attempt to renew the
acquaintance since he has been down here;
and, judging by what I have heard, I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>should not be inclined to encourage him if
he did.”</p>

<p>“But there would be nothing extraordinary
in your visiting him?”</p>

<p>“Possibly not; but I cannot say I have
any wish to try the experiment.”</p>

<p>“You know his history, perhaps?—the
dark stain.”</p>

<p>“I heard of it at the time it happened—not
from Trevlyn, though. It’s a sort of
story that doesn’t make one yearn to renew
acquaintance with the hero.”</p>

<p>For a few moments Monica sat very
still and silent. Then she asked quietly:</p>

<p>“Do you think he is the kind of man to
be dangerous?”</p>

<p>“Dangerous?”</p>

<p>“Yes—if he had taken a vow of vengeance.
Do you think——?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>
<p>“Well, what?”</p>

<p>“Think he would try very hard to
accomplish such a vow? Do people never
in these days try to do an injury to a
man they hate?”</p>

<p>Tom began to understand her now.</p>

<p>“Well, one cannot lay down hard and
fast lines; but it is not now customary for
a man to attempt the sort of vengeance
that he would have done a century or so
back. He tries in these days to hurt an
enemy morally by injuring his reputation;
and I think no one need stand in much
awe of Fitzgerald, least of all a man like
your husband. It is necessary to possess a
reputation of one’s own to undermine that
of another with much success. Fitzgerald
certainly has a reputation, but not the kind
that makes him dangerous as an enemy.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>
<p>Monica heard this dictum in silence.
She did not appear much relieved, and he
saw it.</p>

<p>“Now you anticipate,” he continued,
quite quietly and unemotionally, “that
he will make a regular attack upon Trevlyn
one of these days?”</p>

<p>“I am afraid so sometimes,” answered
Monica. “It may be very foolish; but I
am afraid. He always seems watching us.
Hardly a day goes by but I see him, with
such an evil look in his eye. Tom, I
sometimes think that he is going mad.”</p>

<p>The young man’s face changed slightly.</p>

<p>“That, of course, would put a new
colour on the matter. Have you any reasons
upon which to base your suspicions?”</p>

<p>“Nothing that you would perhaps call
reasons, but they make me suspicious.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>Randolph, spoke of a touch of insanity that
he had fancied lurked in his brain. At
least, when he hates he seems to hate with
a ferocity that suggests the idea of madness.
Tom, if you were to see him, should you
know?”</p>

<p>Tom mused a little.</p>

<p>“I might be able to hazard a shrewd
guess, perhaps. Why do you want so much
to know?”</p>

<p>Without answering, Monica propounded
another question. “If he were mad, he
would be much more dangerous, would he
not?”</p>

<p>“Yes; and if really dangerous, could be
placed under proper control.”</p>

<p>A look of relief crossed Monica’s face.</p>

<p>“Could that be done?”</p>

<p>“Certainly, if absolute madness could be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>proved. But you know in many cases
this is most difficult to demonstrate; and
in Fitzgerald’s independent position it
might be exceedingly hard to get the
needful evidence.”</p>

<p>Her face clouded again.</p>

<p>“But you will see him, Tom? You will
try to find out?”</p>

<p>He hesitated a little. To tell the truth
he did not care about the job. He had a
hearty contempt for the man himself, did
not attach much weight to Monica’s
suspicions, and thought her fears far-fetched.
But her pleading face prevailed.</p>

<p>“Well, Monica, if you particularly wish
it, I will endeavour to meet him, and
enter into a sort of speaking acquaintance.
I don’t promise to force myself
upon him if he avoids me pointedly, but I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>will do what I can in a casual sort of way
to find out something about him. But it
is not at all likely he will prove mad
enough to be placed under restraint.”</p>

<p>“I believe he drinks,” said Monica, softly.
“He used not to, but I believe he does
now.”</p>

<p>“Well, if he has a screw loose and
drinks as well, he may make an end of
himself in time. At any rate, if it will
relieve your mind, I will find out what
I can about him.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Tom; I am very much
obliged to you; and if you cannot do
much, at least you can keep your eye
upon him, and let me know how long
he stays here. I—I—it may be very
foolish; but I don’t want Randolph to
come back till he has gone.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>
<p>Tom’s eyebrows went up.</p>

<p>“Then you really are afraid?”</p>

<p>She smiled faintly.</p>

<p>“I believe I am.”</p>

<p>“Well, it sounds very absurd; but I
have a sort of a faith in your premonitions.
Anyway, I will keep your words in
mind, and do what I can; and
we will try and get him off the field
before you are ready to return to it. I
should not think the attractions of the
place will hold him long.”</p>

<p>So Monica went off to Scotland with a
lightened heart; and yet the shadow of
the haunting fear did not vanish entirely
even in the sunshine of her great happiness.</p>

<h2 title="19. IN SCOTLAND">CHAPTER THE NINETEENTH.<br />

<small>IN SCOTLAND.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“An empty sky and a world of heather.”</p>

<p>Such was the scene that met Monica’s
eye as she stepped out into the clear
morning sunshine, and gazed out over
the wide expanse of moorland that lay
in a kind of purple glory all around
her.</p>

<p>Randolph’s shooting-box was situated
in a very lonely, yet wonderfully picturesque
spot. It seemed as if it had
just been dropped down upon its little
craggy eminence amid this rolling sea of
billowy heather, and had anchored itself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>there without more ado. There was no
attempt at park or garden, or enclosed
ground of any kind. The moor itself was
park and garden in one, and the heather
and gorse grew right up to the wide
terrace walk upon which the south
windows of the little house opened. A
plantation of pine and fir behind gave
protection from the winter winds, and
shade from the summer sun; but save for
this little wood—an oasis in a blooming
desert—the moor stretched away in its
wild freedom on every hand, the white
road alone, glimpses of which could be
seen here and there, seeming to connect
it with the great world beyond.</p>

<p>Trevlyn was lonely and isolated enough,
but it almost seemed to Monica, as she
gazed over the sunny moorland that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>glorious summer morning, as if she had
never been so utterly remote from the
abode of man as she was to-day.</p>

<p>There was a step behind her, and a hand
was laid upon her shoulder.</p>

<p>“Well, Monica?”</p>

<p>She turned to him with lips that
quivered as they smiled.</p>

<p>“It is all so exquisite, Randolph—so
perfect. You did not tell me half.”</p>

<p>“You like it, my Monica?”</p>

<p>“Like it! It seems as if you and I were
just alone in the world together.” He
bent his head and touched her brow with
his lips.</p>

<p>“And that contents you, Monica?”</p>

<p>She looked up with eloquent eyes.</p>

<p>“Need you ask that question now?”</p>

<p>His smile expressed an unspeakable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>happiness; he put his arm about her
saying softly:</p>

<p>“There are some questions one never
tires of hearing answered, sweet wife.
Ah, Monica! when I think of the past, I
feel as if it were almost necessary to have
lived through that, to know what such
happiness as ours can be. It is the former
doubt that makes the present certainty so
unutterably sweet. Do you ever feel that
yourself, my darling?”</p>

<p>He spoke gravely and gently, as they
stood together in the golden sunshine. She
looked up into his face with deep love
and reverence, yet he felt her slight form
quiver in his clasp. He looked at her
smilingly.</p>

<p>“What is it, Monica?”</p>

<p>“Nothing—only a strange feeling I have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>sometimes. I know what you mean,
Randolph. You are quite, quite right—only
do not let us to-day think of the
sorrow that went before. Let us be happy
with one another.”</p>

<p>“We will, my Monica. You are quite
right. This is our bridal holiday, of which
circumstances cheated us at the outset,
and as such we will enjoy it. Come in to
breakfast now; and then we will have the
horses out, and you and I will explore our
new world together, and forget there is any
other before or behind us.”</p>

<p>The shadow fled from Monica’s brow, the
happy light came back to her eyes, came
back and took up its abode there as if
never to depart again. What happy,
happy days were those that followed! No
one invaded the solitude which was such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>bliss to the two who had sought it; no
foot crossed the threshold of the peaceful
home that Randolph had made ready with
such care for the reception of his bride.</p>

<p>And yet, as everything must end at last,
pleasure as well as pain, joy as well as
sorrow, a day came at last when it was
needful to leave this happy seclusion, and
mingle once again with the busier stream
of life that flowed onwards, ever onwards,
outside the walls of their retreat.</p>

<p>Engagements had been made before,
pledges given to various friends that visits
should be paid during that period so dear
to the heart of man, “the shooting season.”
Little enough did Randolph care for sport in
his present mood; far rather would he have
spent longer time alone with his wife in
happy isolation; but his friends became
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>urgent, letters persecuted them with increased
vehemence, and Monica, casting
away her first reluctance, roused herself
to say at last that she thought they ought
to go.</p>

<p>“We shall be together still, Randolph,”
she said, with a little laugh. “It is not
as if we should not have one another.
No one can separate us now, and we
ought to be able to be happy anywhere
together.”</p>

<p>And yet, when the time came, it was
very hard to go. Randolph came upon
Monica the last evening at sunset, watching
the glorious pageantry of the sky, with
something of the old wistfulness upon her
face.</p>

<p>“You are sorry to be leaving then,
Monica?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>
<p>She started, and turned to him, almost as
if for protection.</p>

<p>“Yes, I am sorry. We have been so
very, very happy here. Randolph, is it
very foolish? Sometimes I feel as if such
happiness were too great for this world—as
if it <em>could</em> not go on always so. It
seems almost too beautiful, too perfect.
Do you ever feel the same?”</p>

<p>“I know what you mean, sweet wife.
Yet I am not afraid of our happiness or of
the future. It is love that brings the
brightness with it, and I think nothing now
can change our love.”</p>

<p>“Ah, no, no!” she cried impetuously;
“nothing can change that. You always
understand. Randolph, you are so strong,
so good, so patient. Ah! what should I
do without you now?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>
<p>“You have not got to do without me,
Monica. A husband cannot be set aside
by anyone or anything. You must not let
nervous fears get the better of you. Tell
me, is anything troubling you to-night?”</p>

<p>“No, no; only that the old feeling will
sometimes come back. It is foolish, I
know; but I cannot quite rid myself of
it.”</p>

<p>“The old feeling?”</p>

<p>“Yes, that some trouble is coming upon
me—upon us. I cannot explain; but I
feel it sometimes—I feel as if it were
coming nearer.”</p>

<p>He did not laugh at her fears. He only
said very gently and tenderly:</p>

<p>“I pray God, my sweet wife, that
trouble may be very far away from you;
yet if it comes, I know it will be bravely,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>nobly borne, and that the furnace of
sorrow will only bring out the gold more
bright and pure than ever.”</p>

<p>She glanced at him, and then over the
purple moorlands and into the glorious
western sky. A look of deep, settled purpose
shone out of her eyes, and her face grew
calm and resolute. She thought of that
moment often in days to come, and of her
husband’s words. It was a recollection
always fraught with much of strengthening
comfort.</p>

<p>The round of inevitable visits to be
paid proved less irksome than Monica had
anticipated.</p>

<p>Randolph’s friends were pleasant, well-bred
people, with whom it was easy to get
on, and to make things more easy for
Monica, Beatrice Wentworth and her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>brother were not unfrequently numbered
among the house party they were invited
to meet.</p>

<p>Both the young earl and his sister were devoted
to Monica, and their presence added
much to her enjoyment of the different visits
that they paid together. Lord Haddon was
her constant attendant whenever her husband
could not be with her, and his frank,
boyish homage was accepted in the spirit
in which it was offered. Monica, though
much admired and liked, was not “popular”
in the ordinary sense of the term.
She did not attract round her a crowd of
amused admirers, as Beatrice did, and most
young men, however much they might
admire her stately beauty, found her
somewhat difficult to get on with. With
elderly people she was more at ease, and a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>great favourite from her gentleness and
peculiar refinement of thought and
manner; but for the most part, during
the gay doings of the day, she was left to
the attendance of Randolph or Haddon,
and no arrangement could have been more
to her own liking.</p>

<p>Yet one trifling incident occurred to
disturb her peace of mind, although she
thought she possibly dwelt upon it more
than the circumstance warranted.</p>

<p>She was at a large luncheon party, to
which her hostess and guests had alike
been invited to meet many other parties
from surrounding houses.</p>

<p>A grand battue in the park had drawn
away most of the sportsmen, and the
ladies were lunching almost by themselves.
Monica’s surprise was somewhat great to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>find in her right-hand neighbour none other
than Cecilia Bellamy, with whom her last
interview had been anything but agreeable.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bellamy, however, seemed to have
forgotten all about that.</p>

<p>“It is really you, Monica. I hoped I
should meet you somewhere; I heard you
were staying about; I know I’ve behaved
badly. I ought to have written to you
when your father died. I was awfully
sorry, I was indeed. We were always
fond of the earl, Conrad and I. He was
so good to us when we were children. It
was horrid of me not to write, but I never
do know how to write a letter of condolence.
I hope you’re not very angry
with me.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, no,” answered Monica. “Indeed,
I never thought about it.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>
<p>“I knew you wouldn’t care to hear from
me,” pursued the lively little woman. “I
didn’t behave nicely to you, Monica, and
I’m sorry now I listened to Conrad’s persuasions;
but I’m so easy-going, and
thought it all fun. I’m sorry now. I
really am, for I’ve got shaken in my confidence
in Master Conrad. I believe he’ll
go to the dogs still, for all his professions.
By-the-bye, did you ever see him after you
got back to Trevlyn?”</p>

<p>“Once or twice. I believe he was living
in his house down there.”</p>

<p>“That dreadful old barn! I can’t think
how he can exist there. He will take
to drink, and go mad, I do believe, if
he stays six months in such a place.
Monica, I don’t want to frighten you—I
may be silly to think such a thing,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>but I can’t believe he’s after any good
there.”</p>

<p>Monica shivered a little instinctively.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“I don’t quite know what I do mean.
If you weren’t such an old friend, of course
I couldn’t say a word; but you know
perhaps that there’s something rather odd
sometimes about Conrad.”</p>

<p>“Odd?”</p>

<p>“Yes—I know he’s bad enough; but it’s
when he has his odd fits on that he’s worse.
I don’t believe he is always altogether
responsible. He’s given way, and now he
can’t always help himself, I do think. He
isn’t mad, of course, but he can be very
wild at times,” and she glanced at her companion
with something of significance.</p>

<p>“Why do you say all this to me?”
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>asked Monica, with a sort of apprehension.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bellamy laughed a little.</p>

<p>“Why, can’t you see? Don’t you know
how he hates your husband?”</p>

<p>Monica’s face blanched a little.</p>

<p>“But you don’t mean——”</p>

<p>“No, no, of course not,” with a short
laugh that had little of mirth in it. “I
don’t mean anything—only I think, if ever
Conrad is lurking about in his wild moods,
that Lord Trevlyn had better keep a sharp
look out. Your woods and cliffs are nasty
lonely places, and it’s always well to be on
the safe side.”</p>

<p>Monica sat pale and silent; Mrs.
Bellamy laughed again in that half uneasy
way.</p>

<p>“Now, don’t look like that, and keep
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>your own counsel. I’m a silly woman,
as you know, and nobody minds what I
say, but I can’t be quite comfortable
without just warning you. For mischief is
sometimes done in a moment between two
angry men that never can be undone so
long as the world lasts. Now don’t go and
get frightened, Monica—it may be all a
ridiculous fancy; but just keep your eyes
open.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Cecilia,” said Monica
quietly. “I will.”</p>

<small>A VISIT TO ARTHUR.</small></h2></div>


<p>“Are you getting tired of this sort of
thing, Monica?” asked Randolph, about
three days later.</p>

<p>He had fancied he detected traces of
weariness at times—weariness or anxiety:
he could hardly have told which—in the
lines of her face; and he thought that
possibly some trouble was resting upon
her. He was very quick to note the least
change in one he loved so well.</p>

<p>Her smile, however, was very reassuring.</p>

<p>“I think I should never be really tired
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>of any life you shared, Randolph; but I
like being alone together best.”</p>

<p>“I, too,” he responded, with great
sincerity. “Monica, as we have done our
duty by society now, shall we indulge ourselves
once more, and leave the world to
wag on its own way, and forget it again
for a few more happy weeks?”</p>

<p>Her face was bright and eager.</p>

<p>“Go back to the moorland shooting-box,
Randolph?” she questioned.</p>

<p>“No; not that quite. The season is
getting a little late for remaining up in the
north. I have a better plan in my head
for you.”</p>

<p>“Are we going back to Trevlyn,
then?”</p>

<p>“Trevlyn is not ready for us; it will
be some time before it is. Can you think
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>of nothing else you would like to do?—of
nobody you want to see?”</p>

<p>A flush rose suddenly into Monica’s face:
her eyes shone with happiness.</p>

<p>“Oh, Randolph! are you going to take
me to see Arthur?”</p>

<p>“You would like to go?”</p>

<p>“Above everything.”</p>

<p>“Then the thing is done. We will start
next week. I talked about it to the doctor
when I saw him, and he advised three
months of entire quiet and seclusion whilst
he settled down to the new life. After
that, he believed there would be no reason
at all against his seeing friends from home.
I wrote again last week to put the question
definitely, and the answer is entirely satisfactory.
If you want to go, Monica, the
whole question is settled.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>
<p>She came close up to him, clasping her
hands upon his shoulder, and looking up
with loving gratitude and delight.</p>

<p>“You think of everything, Randolph.
You are so good to me. It is just the one
thing to make my happiness complete: to
see my boy again, and make sure with
my own eyes that he is well cared for and
content with his life. I want to be able to
picture him where he is. I want to hear
him say that he is happy: that he does
not pine after Trevlyn.”</p>

<p>“I think you will have your wish, then,
Monica, for, from what I can gather, he
is very well pleased with his quarters, and
improved health makes life pleasant and
full of zest. He has the natural love of
change that you never knew, and your
inherited love for your old home is not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>really shared by him to any great extent
now that he has tried another life. Trevlyn
is not woven into the very fibres of
his heart as into yours. I think the home-sickness
passed off quickly with him.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I daresay. I believe I was foolish
myself about Trevlyn, and taught him to
be foolish too. Why is it that the younger
we are, and the less we know, the more we
are convinced we are always right? I
have made so many, many mistakes.
Once I thought you did not love me,
Randolph.”</p>

<p>It was sweet to him still to hear her
speak thus, with the intonation that
always thrilled him through—with the
look upon her face so much more eloquent
than any words. It was sweet to feel her
loving confidence and dependence. Again
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>and again he vowed deep down in his
heart that she should never know a trouble
from which he could save her.</p>

<p>The journey was approved by both. It
would take them away once again from
the round of social duties and pleasures—of
which for the time being they had had
enough—and leave them practically alone
together, to be all in all to one another, as
was now their greatest happiness.</p>

<p>“It is too bad of you to run away,
Monica,” Beatrice grumbled, when she
heard the news. “Your brother can’t
want you more than we do here. And if
you go, you’ll vanish no one knows for
how long, as you did before, and then you
will go and bury yourselves in your enchanted
castle right away by the sea, and
nobody will hear of you any more. I call
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>it too bad: just as we were getting to be
friends and learning to know you.”</p>

<p>Monica smiled at the imputation of vanishing
so entirely.</p>

<p>“You shall hear of us sometimes, I
promise you,” she answered. “If you and
your brother will not find the ‘enchanted
castle’ too dull, I hope you will come
and see us there when we go back in the
autumn. There are not a great many
attractions, I am afraid, but there is some
shooting and hunting. I should like to
show you Trevlyn some day, Beatrice,
though I believe it will be a good deal
changed from the place I have sometimes
described to you.”</p>

<p>“It is sure to be perfect, whatever it is
like,” was the quick response. “I should
think we would come—Haddon and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>—if
ever we get an invitation. I always
did long to see Trevlyn, and I am sure he
does the same, though he is no hand at
pretty speeches, poor old boy!”</p>

<p>Haddon smiled, and coloured a little;
but answered frankly enough.</p>

<p>“Lady Trevlyn does not want pretty
speeches, as you call it, made to her,
Beatrice. She knows quite well what a
pleasure it would be to visit her and Randolph
at Trevlyn.”</p>

<p>“I should like my husband’s oldest
friends to see the place,” she answered,
smiling. “So we will call that matter
settled when we really do get home;
though I do not quite know when that
will be.”</p>

<p>Next day Randolph and Monica said
good-bye to Scotland, and began their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>journey southward. They were in no
great haste, and travelled by easy stages.
Arthur was to be told nothing of the
prospective visit, which was to be kept as
a surprise till the last moment. Monica
was never a very good correspondent, even
where Arthur was concerned, and if she
posted a letter to him, last thing before
leaving England, he would not be surprised
at a silence of a fortnight or more, by
which time at latest she would be with him.</p>

<p>So they took their time over their
journey, and the strangeness of all she saw
possessed a curious charm for Monica, when
viewed beneath her husband’s protecting
care, and in his constant company. He
took her to a few quaint Norman towns,
with their fine old churches and picturesque
streets and market-places; then to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>Paris, where a few days were passed in
seeing the sights, and watching the vivid,
hurrying, glittering life of that gay
capital.</p>

<p>Steering an erratic course, turning this
way and that to visit any place of interest,
or any romantic spot that Randolph
thought would please his wife, they approached
their destination, and presently
reached the pretty, picturesque little town,
hardly more than a village, which was only
just rising to importance, on account of
the value of its mineral springs lately
discovered.</p>

<p>One good-sized hotel and the doctor’s
establishment, both of which stood at the
same end of the village, and a little distance
from it, testified to the rising importance
of the place. Randolph had secured comfortable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>rooms in the former, where they
arrived late one evening.</p>

<p>Monica liked the place; it was not in
the least like what she had pictured, far
more pretty, more primitive, and more
country-like. Wooded hills, surrounded
the valley in which it lay. A broad
rapid stream ran through it, spanned
by more than one grey stone bridge,
and the irregularly-built village was
quite a picture in its way, with its
quaint old houses, with their carved
gables and little wooden balconies, and
the spire of its church rising above the
surrounding trees. Viewed by moonlight,
as she saw it first, it was a charming little
place; and the charm did not vanish with
the more prosaic light of day.</p>

<p>The interview with the doctor was most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>satisfactory. He was a kindly, simple-minded
man, much interested in his patient
from a professional standpoint, and fond
of the lad for his own sake. Monica’s
beauty and sweetness were evidently not
lost upon him. He had heard much of
her from the young Herr, he explained,
and could understand well the feelings he
had so often heard expressed.</p>

<p>No, the invalid had not been told of the
expected arrival. He did not know but
that Lord and Lady Trevlyn were in
England. Did the noble lady wish to go
to him? He would honour himself by
leading the way.</p>

<p>Monica followed him with a beating
heart. They went up a wide carpetless
staircase, and on the first landing her guide
paused, and indicated a certain door.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>
<p>“He is up; madame can go straight in.
A joyful surprise will but do him good.”</p>

<p>Monica turned the handle, and entered,
as quietly and calmly as if this had been
the daily visit to the old room at Trevlyn.
Arthur was lying with his back to the
door. He was reading, and did not turn
his head, fancying it was the servant entering,
as he heard the rustle of a dress.</p>

<p>Monica came and stood behind him,
laying her hand upon his head.</p>

<p>“Arthur!” she said softly.</p>

<p>Then he started as if he had been shot.</p>

<p>He sat up with an energy that showed a
decided increase of strength, holding out
his hands in eager welcome.</p>

<p>“Monica! Monica!” he cried, in a sort
of rapturous excitement. “It is Monica
herself!”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>
<p>She bent over him and kissed him again
and again, and would have made him lie
down again; but he was too excited to
obey.</p>

<p>“Monica! My own Monica! When did
you come? What does it all mean? Oh,
this is too splendid! Where’s Randolph?”</p>

<p>“Here,” answered that familiar voice,
just within the door. “Well, my boy, how
are you getting on? Like a house on fire,
eh? Monica and I are on our wedding
trip, you know. We thought we would
finish it off by coming to have a look at
you. Well, you look pretty comfortable
up here, and have made fine progress, I
hear, since I saw you last. Like everything
as much as you make out in your
letters, eh?”</p>

<p>“Oh! I’m all right enough. Never
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>mind me. Tell me about yourselves.
Whose idea was this? I call it just
splendid!”</p>

<p>“Randolph’s idea,” answered Monica.
“All the good ideas are his now, Arthur.
We have come to stay a whole fortnight
with you; and when I have seen everything
with my own eyes, and am quite
convinced that everybody is treating you
well, I shall go home content to Trevlyn,
to wait till you can join us there.”</p>

<p>“I mustn’t think of that just yet,”
answered Arthur, cheerfully. “My old
doctor says it will be a year—perhaps two—before
I shall really be on my legs again;
but he is quite sure he is going to cure me,
which is all that matters. I am awfully
comfortable here, and there are some jolly
little children of his, who come and amuse
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>me by the hour together. Oh, yes! I have
capital times. I couldn’t be more comfortable
anywhere: and if you and
Randolph come sometimes to see me, I
shall have nothing left to wish for.”</p>

<p>Certainly Arthur was surrounded by
every luxury that wealth could bestow.
There was none of the foreign bareness
about his rooms that characterised its
other apartments. Randolph had ordered
everything that could possibly add to his
comfort, and make things home-like for
him, even to the open fire-place, with its
cheerful fire of logs, although the stove still
retained its place, and in cold weather did
valuable service in keeping an even
temperature in the room.</p>

<p>Arthur’s visitors had made him gradually
understand how much more sumptuously
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>he was lodged than other patients, and he
well knew to whom he owed the luxuries
he enjoyed. He explained all this to
Monica, and in her own sweet way she
thanked her husband for his tenderness
towards her boy.</p>

<p>“I always feel as if Arthur were a sort
of link between us, Monica,” he said. “I
am sure he was in those old days, when we
were strangers to each other. I owe him a
great deal that he knows nothing about.
Were it only for that, I must always love
him, and feel towards him as towards a
brother.”</p>

<p>Quickly and happily the days slipped by
and the pleasant visit drew to its close. It
lengthened out into nearly three weeks;
but at last the news came that Trevlyn was
ready for its master and mistress, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>Arthur bid a brave farewell to those who
had done so much for him, and settled himself
with cheerful readiness to his winter
with his new friends. A visit next spring
and summer was confidently promised, and
he saw his guest go with an unselfish
brightness that was in no way assumed.</p>

<p>Monica was quite happy about him
now, and, though the parting was a little
hard, she was as brave as he. She turned
her face homeward with a light heart.
Only one little cloud of anxiety lay upon
her heart. “What was Conrad Fitzgerald
doing? Was he still lurking about
Trevlyn?”</p>

<p>Even that question was destined to be
answered in a satisfactory manner before
many days had passed.</p>

<p>They travelled rapidly homewards, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>the season was advancing, and they were
anxious to be once more at Trevlyn.</p>

<p>They were in a train, which had stopped
at some station, when another train from
an opposite direction steamed up and also
stopped. Monica, leaning back in her
corner seat, noticed nothing for a time, but
was roused to the consciousness that she
was being intently regarded by a passenger
in the opposite train, whose face was
pressed close against the glass.</p>

<p>For some seconds she resisted the impulse
to look; but as she felt the glance withdrawn,
she presently turned her eyes in the
direction of the half-seen face, and then
she started violently.</p>

<p>Conrad Fitzgerald, his face pale and
sharp, wearing a frightfully malevolent
expression, was gazing, or rather glaring,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>at her husband, with eyes like those of a
wild beast, in their fiery, hungry hate.</p>

<p>Randolph, seated opposite her, reading
the paper, was perfectly unconscious of
the proximity of his foe; but Monica
recoiled with a feeling of horror she could
hardly have explained.</p>

<p>The next moment the train had moved
on. At least, it was some comfort to know
that they were being rapidly carried in
opposite directions. Yet it was long before
she could forget the vindictive hatred of
the gaze she had seen directed towards her
husband.</p>

<p>Would Conrad Fitzgerald ever do him
the deadly injury he had vowed?</p>

<h2 title="21. BACK AT TREVLYN">CHAPTER THE TWENTY-FIRST.<br />

<small>BACK AT TREVLYN.</small></h2></div>


<p>“Randolph! Can this really be
Trevlyn?”</p>

<p>The young countess stood in all her
radiant loveliness upon the threshold of her
old home, and turned her happy face
towards the husband who stood beside her,
watching with a smile in his eyes for the
effect to be produced by his labour of
love.</p>

<p>“Can this really be Trevlyn?”</p>

<p>“You seemed destined never to know
your old home again when you have been
banished from it, Monica,” he answered,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>smiling. “Well, is it as much changed as
you expected?”</p>

<p>“It is perfect,” said Monica simply;
adding, after another long look round her:
“If only my father could have seen this—could
have lived to witness the realisation
of his dream!”</p>

<p>But he would not let her indulge one sad
thought that should cloud the brightness
of this happy home-coming. He kissed her
gently in token of his sympathy, and then
drew her towards the blazing fire, whose
dancing flames were illuminating the great
hall.</p>

<p>“Does it realise your dream, too, my
Monica?” he asked softly.</p>

<p>She looked up in his face, deep feeling
welling up in the glance of her soft dark
eyes.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>
<p>“To be with you is my dream,
Randolph. That is enough for me.”</p>

<p>He saw that she was moved, and knew
that the associations of Trevlyn, the old
home, were crowding upon her. Without
speaking, he led her towards a door, which
in old days led to a room vast and empty,
save for the odds and ends of lumber that
gradually accumulated there. Monica
glanced up in a sort of surprise as he
turned the handle. Why was he taking
her there?</p>

<p>She paused on the threshold, and looked
about her in mute amaze.</p>

<p>The floor was of polished parquetrie
work; the panelled walls, quaintly and
curiously carved, shone with the care that
had been bestowed upon them; the
vaulted roof had been carefully restored
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>and was a fine specimen of mediæval skill
and beauty. The mullioned window to the
west had been filled with rich stained glass,
that gave back a dusky glimmer through
its tinted panes, though the daylight was
failing fast. Near to the window stood the
one great feature of the room, an organ,
which Monica’s eyes saw at once was a
particularly fine and perfect instrument.
An organ of her very own! It was just
like Randolph to think of it! She gave
him one sweet glance of gratitude, and
went up to it in the dim, dusky twilight.</p>

<p>“How good you are to me!” she said
softly.</p>

<p>He heard the little quiver in her voice,
and bent his head to kiss her; but he
spoke in a lighter tone.</p>

<p>“Do you like it? I am so glad! I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>thought your home ought not to be
without its music-room. See, Monica,
your organ will be a sort of friend to whom
you can confide all your secrets; for you
want nobody to blow it for you. You can
set the bellows at work by just turning
this handle, and nobody need disturb
your solitude when you want to be alone.”</p>

<p>She looked up gratefully. He never
forgot anything—not even her old love for
solitude.</p>

<p>“I never want to be alone now,
Randolph,” she said. “I always want
you.”</p>

<p>“And you generally have me, sweet
wife. I think we have hardly been
separated for more than a few hours at a
time since that happy, happy day that made
you really mine.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>
<p>“I want it always to be like that,” said
Monica, dreamily; “always like that.”</p>

<p>He looked at her, and carried the hand
that he held to his lips.</p>

<p>“Will you play, Monica?”</p>

<p>She sat down and struck a few dreamy
chords, gradually leading up to the theme
that was in her mind. Randolph leaned
against the mullioned window-frame and
watched her. He could see, even in the
darkness, the pure, pale outline of her
perfect profile, and the crown of her
golden hair that framed her face like an
aureole.</p>

<p>“Another dream realised, Monica,” he
said softly, as she turned to him at length.</p>

<p>“What dream, Randolph?”</p>

<p>“A dream that came to me once, in the
little cliff church where we were married,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>as I watched you—little as you knew it—sitting
at the organ, and playing to yourself,
one sunny afternoon. But this is
better than any dream of pictured saint
or spirit—my Monica, my own true wife.”</p>

<p>She looked up at him, and came and put
her arms about his neck—an unusual
demonstration, even now, for her, and they
stood very close together in the gathering
darkness that was not dark to them.</p>


<p class="mt2">Monica paid an early visit to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Maws
to see her friends, and to confide to Mrs.
Pendrill a little of the wonderful happiness
that had flooded her life with sunshine.
Then, too, she wanted to see Tom, and to
ask him the result of the mission he had
half promised to undertake. So far she
had learned nothing save that Fitzgerald
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>had not been seen near Trevlyn for many
weeks, and was supposed to have gone
abroad.</p>

<p>“Did you see him, Tom?” she asked,
when she had found the opportunity she
desired.</p>

<p>“Yes, once or twice. I had a good
look at him. I should not call him exactly
mad, though in a decidedly peculiar mental
state. We merely met, as it were, by
chance, and talked on indifferent subjects
for the most part. Once he asked me, in a
sort of veiled way, for professional advice,
describing certain unpleasant symptoms
and sensations. I advised him to give up
the use of spirits, and to try what travelling
would do for him. He seemed to think
he would take my advice, and shortly
afterwards he disappeared from the neighbourhood;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>but where he has gone I do not
know.”</p>

<p>Monica knew that this advice had been
followed. “He may go anywhere he likes,
if he will only keep away from here,” she
said. “I am very much obliged to you,
Tom, for doing as I asked.”</p>

<p>“Pray don’t mention it.”</p>

<p>“I must mention it, because it was very
good of you. Tom, will you come and
stay at Trevlyn next week? We have one
or two people coming for the pheasants,
and we want you to make one of the party,
if you will.”</p>

<p>“Oh, very well; anything to please. I have
had no shooting worth speaking of so far.
I should like a week’s holiday very well.”</p>

<p>So that matter was speedily and easily
arranged.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>
<p>Tom did not ask who were the guests he
was to meet, and Monica did not think of
naming such entire strangers, Lord Haddon
and Lady Beatrice Wentworth. She forgot
that Tom and the young earl had met once
before on a different occasion.</p>

<p>Those two were to be the first guests.
Perhaps later on they would ask more, but
Monica was too entirely happy in her
present life to wish it in any way disturbed,
and Randolph by no means cared to be
obliged to give up to guests those happy
hours that heretofore he had always spent
with Monica. But Beatrice and her
brother had already been invited. They
were his oldest friends, and were Monica’s
friends too. She was glad to welcome them
to her old home, and the rapturous
admiration that its beauties elicited would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>have satisfied a more exacting nature than
hers.</p>

<p>Beatrice was, as usual, radiant, bewitching,
delightful. Monica wished that Tom
had come in time to see her arrival, and
listen to her sparkling flow of talk. Tom
professed to be a woman-hater, or next
door to it, but she thought that even he
would have to make an exception in
favour of Lady Beatrice Wentworth.</p>

<p>She went upstairs with her guest to her
room at length, when Beatrice suddenly
turned towards her, with quite a new expression
upon her face.</p>

<p>“Monica,” she said, looking straight
into her eyes, “you are changed—you are
different from what you were in London—different
even from what you were in
Scotland, though I saw a change then. I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>don’t know how to express it, but you are
beautified—glorified. What is it? What
has changed you since I first knew you?”</p>

<p>Monica knew right well; but some
feelings could not be translated into
words.</p>

<p>“I am very happy,” she said, quietly.
“If there is any change, that must be the
cause.”</p>

<p>“Happier than you have ever been
before?”</p>

<p>“Yes; I think every week makes me
happier. I learn to know my husband
better and better, you see.”</p>

<p>A sudden wistful sadness flashed into
the eyes so steadily regarding her.
Monica saw it before it had been blotted
out by the arch drollery of the look that
immediately succeeded.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>
<p>“And it does not wear off, Monica?
Sometimes it does, you know—after a
time. Will it ever, in your case, do you
think?”</p>

<p>“I think not,” she answered.</p>

<p>“And I think not, too,” answered
Beatrice. “Ah me! How happy some
people are!”</p>

<p>She laughed, but there was something of
bitterness in the tone. Monica looked at
her seriously.</p>

<p>“Are you not happy, Beatrice?”</p>

<p>The girl’s audacious smile beamed out
over her face.</p>

<p>“Don’t I look so?”</p>

<p>“Sometimes—not always.”</p>

<p>“One must have variety before all
things, you know,” was the gay answer.
“It would never do to be always in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>same style—it lacks piquancy after a time.
Now let me have time to beautify myself in
harmony with this most charming of old
places, and come back for me when you
are dressed; I feel as if I should lose my
way, or see bogies in these delightful corridors
and staircases.”</p>

<p>And Monica left her guest as desired,
coming back, half an hour later, to find
her transformed into the semblance of some
pictured dame of a century or two gone
by, in stiff amber brocade, quaintly cut
about the neck and sleeves, and relieved
here and there by dazzling scarlet
blossoms. Beatrice never at any time
looked like anybody else, but to-night she
was particularly, strikingly original.</p>

<p>“Ah, you black-robed queen, you will
just do as a foil for me!” was the greeting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>Monica received. “Whenever I see you
in any garb, no matter what it is, I always
think it is just one that suits you best of
everything. Are you having a dinner-party
to-night?”</p>

<p>“Not exactly. A few men are coming,
who have asked Randolph to shoot since
we came back. You and I are the only
ladies.”</p>

<p>And then they went down to the empty
drawing-room a good half-hour before any
one else was likely to appear.</p>

<p>Beatrice chatted away very brightly. She
seemed in gay spirits, and had a great deal
to tell of what had passed since their farewell
in Scotland a month or two ago.</p>

<p>She moved about the drawing-room,
examining the various treasures it contained,
and admiring the beauty of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>pictures. She was standing half concealed
by the curtains draping a recessed window,
when the door opened, admitting Tom
Pendrill. He was in dinner dress, having
arrived about an hour previously.</p>

<p>“You have come then, Tom,” said
Monica. “I am glad. I was afraid you
meant to desert us after all.”</p>

<p>“The wish being father to the thought,
I presume,” answered Tom, shaking hands.
“By-the-bye, here is a letter from Arthur’s
doctor I’ve brought to show you. He
gives a capital account of his patient.
Can you read German writing, or shall I
construe? He writes about as crabbedly
as——”</p>

<p>And here Tom stopped short, seeing that
Monica was not alone.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon,” he added, drawing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>himself up with a ceremoniousness quite
unusual with him.</p>

<p>“Not at all,” answered Monica, quietly.
“Let me introduce you to Lady Beatrice
Wentworth—Mr. Tom Pendrill.”</p>

<p>They exchanged bows very distantly.
Monica became suddenly aware, in some
subtle, inexplicable fashion, that these two
were not strangers to one another—that
this was not their first meeting. Moreover,
it appeared as if their former acquaintance,
such as it was, could have
been by no means agreeable to either, for
it was easy to see that a sort of covert
antagonism existed between them which
neither of them took over much pains to
conceal.</p>

<p>Tom’s face assumed its most sharply
cynical expression, as he drew at once into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>his hardest shell of distant reserve and
sarcastic politeness.</p>

<p>Beatrice opened her feather fan, and
wielded it with a sort of aggressive negligence.
She dropped into a seat beside
Monica, and began to talk to her with an
air of studied affectation utterly at variance
with her ordinary manner, ignoring Tom
as entirely as if no introduction had passed
between them, and that with an assumption
of hauteur that could only be explained by a
deeply-seated antipathy.</p>

<p>Monica tried to include Tom in the conversation;
but he declined to be included,
returned an indifferent answer, and withdrew
to a distant corner of the room,
where he remained deeply engrossed, as it
seemed, in the study of a photographic
album.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>
<p>Monica was perplexed. She could not
imagine what it all meant. She had never
heard the Pendrills speak of Lady Beatrice
Wentworth, and she was sufficiently acquainted
with Tom’s history to render this
perplexity the greater. She was certain
Mrs. Pendrill had heard the name of her
expected guest, and it had aroused no
emotion in her. Yet she would presumably
know the name of a lady towards
whom her nephew cherished so great an
antipathy. Monica could not make it out.
But one thing was plain enough: those
two were sworn foes, and intended to
remain so—and they were guests beneath
the same roof!</p>
<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter"><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>



<h2 title="22. AN ENIGMA">CHAPTER THE TWENTY-SECOND.<br />

<small>AN ENIGMA.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>It was a relief when the other men came
in, and when dinner was announced.
Randolph evidently knew nothing of any
disturbing element in the party as he
handed Beatrice in to dinner, and again
made a sort of attempt to introduce her to
Tom, who was seated opposite, not knowing
that Monica had already had an opportunity
of performing that little ceremony.</p>

<p>“You are two of my oldest friends, you
know,” said their host, in his pleasant,
easy fashion, “and you are both my guests
now, so you will have a capital opportunity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>of expatiating together upon my many
perfections.”</p>

<p>“No need for that, Randolph,” answered
Beatrice, gaily. “They speak too loud for
themselves, and your wife’s eyes tell too
many tales of them. You know I never
could bear paragons. If you turn into one,
I shall have no more to say to you.”</p>

<p>“You are very cutting, Beatrice; almost
as much so as Tom here. It is really rather
a trying position to be hedged in between
a clever woman and a clever man.”</p>

<p>“If you call me a clever woman again,
Randolph, I’ll never forgive you. I
abominate the whole race!” cried Beatrice,
hotly; “and as for clever men—I <em>detest</em>
them!”</p>

<p>This was said so heartily as to elicit a
guffaw of laughter from a ruddy-faced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>young gentleman of sporting tastes, who
was her neighbour on the other side. She
turned to him with one of her most sparkling
glances.</p>

<p>“Now you, I am quite certain, agree
with me. Your face tells me you do.
Don’t you think that it is the clever people
who make the world an intolerable place?”</p>

<p>“They’re the greatest nuisance out,”
assented that young gentleman, cordially.
“I always did say so. I was never clever.
I was plucked three times, I think, for my
little-go.”</p>

<p>“Then you and I are sure to be great
friends,” said Beatrice, laughing. “I am
quite, quite sure I should <em>never</em> have passed
any examination if I had been a man. I
was at Oxford once, long ago; and oh!
you know, the only men that were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>any good at all were those who had
been ‘plucked,’ as they call it, or fully
expected to be. The clever, good, precocious
boys were—oh! well, let us not think
of them. It takes away one’s appetite!”</p>

<p>The sporting gentleman laughed, and
enjoyed this summary verdict; but Randolph
just glanced across at his wife. He,
too, was aware that there was something
odd in Beatrice’s manner. He detected the
covert vein of bitterness in her tone; and
he was as much at a loss to understand it
as any one else could be. Tom’s face and
impenetrable silence puzzled him likewise.</p>

<p>Dinner, however, passed smoothly enough.
Beatrice was very lively, and her witticisms
kept all the table alive. Her young neighbour
lost his heart to her at once, and she
flirted with him in the most frank and open
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>fashion possible. She could be very fascinating
when she chose, and to-night, after
the first edge had been taken off her
sallies, she was, undoubtedly, exceedingly
attractive.</p>

<p>If there was something a little forced in
her mirth, at least nobody detected it, save
those who knew her very well, and not
even all of those, for Haddon was obviously
unconscious that anything was wrong, and
talked to Monica in the most unconcerned
fashion possible. What Tom thought of it
all nobody could hazard an opinion.</p>

<p>At length Monica gave the signal to her
animated guest, and they two withdrew
together. Beatrice laughed gaily, as she
half walked half waltzed across the hall,
humming a dance tune the while.</p>

<p>“What a lovely place this would be for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>a dance!” she exclaimed, “a masked, or,
better still, a fancy dress ball. Shouldn’t we
look charming in these panelled rooms,
flitting about this great baronial hall, and
up and down that delightful staircase?
Monica, you and Randolph mustn’t get
lazy; you must live up to your house. It
is too beautiful to be wasted. If you don’t
know how to manage matters, I must
come and teach you?”</p>

<p>And so she rattled on, first on one theme,
and then on another, in restless, aimless
fashion, as people do who are talking
against time, or talking with a purpose,
determined not to let silence fall between
them and their companions. It was easy
to see that Beatrice wished to avoid any
confidential conversation—wished to escape
from any kind of questioning, or from quiet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>talk, of whatever description it might be.
When at length she did let Monica go
back to the drawing-room, it was not with
any idea of silence. She went straight to
the piano, and began playing stormily.</p>

<p>Presently, after dashing off fragments
vocal and instrumental in a sort of
confused medley, Monica, growing dreamy
as she listened to the succession of changing
harmonies, she began once again with
more of purpose and of passion in her voice—indeed,
there was so much of pain and
passion, that Monica was aroused to listen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>
<p>And then the singer’s voice failed utterly;
a dismal discordant chord broke the eager
harmonies that had followed one another
so rapidly. Beatrice broke into a sudden
storm of tears, and hurried from the room
without a word.</p>

<p>Monica sat aghast and bewildered.
What could it all mean? Was she by
chance to come upon the secret sorrow of
Beatrice’s life?—the sorrow she had half
suspected sometimes, but had never heard
in any way explained. Was it to be
explained to her now? Was Tom Pendrill
connected with that sorrow? If so, what
part had he taken? Could they ever have
been lovers? Did she not remember, long
ago, hearing something of a suspicion on
Mrs. Pendrill’s part that Tom had been
“jilted” by the woman he loved? Was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>there not a time, long ago, when he was
not the reserved, cynical man he affected
now to be; but was genial, brilliant, the
pleasantest of companions? Yes, Monica
was sure of it—was certain that he had
changed, and changed somewhat suddenly,
many years since; but she had paid but
little heed to the matter then, as it was
about that time when every faculty was
absorbed in watching over Arthur, who
long lay hovering between life and death.
Changes after that passed almost unheeded.
Had not her whole life been changed
too?</p>

<p>She did not follow Beatrice, however, to
try and comfort her, or attempt to force
her confidence. She treated her as she
would wish herself to be treated in similar
case; and shortly after the gentlemen had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>joined them, had the satisfaction of seeing
Beatrice come back as brilliant and full of
vivacity as ever, and there was no need
after her appearance, to wonder how the
evening should be passed, it seemed quite
sufficient entertainment for the company to
sit in a circle round her, and hear Beatrice
talk. Tom Pendrill was the one exception.
He did not attempt to join the magic ring.
He took Monica a little apart, and talked
over with her the latest news from
Germany.</p>

<p>When the guests had departed, and
Beatrice, as well as her brother and
Monica, had gone upstairs, Tom turned
his face towards Randolph with its hardest
and most cynical look.</p>

<p>“Tell you what, Trevlyn, don’t you ask
that poor young fellow Radlet here again,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>so long as that arrant flirt is a guest under
your roof.”</p>

<p>Randolph simply smiled.</p>

<p>“The ‘arrant flirt,’ as you are polite
enough to call my guest, is one of my
oldest friends. Kindly keep that fact in
mind in talking of her to me.”</p>

<p>“I am not talking of her. I am talking
of poor young Radlet.”</p>

<p>“It seems to me that poor young Radlet,
as you call him, is very well able to take
care of himself.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you think that, do you? Shows
how much <em>you</em> know! Can’t you see she
was doing her very best to enslave his
fancy, and that he was falling under the
spell as fast as ever he could?”</p>

<p>“Pooh! Nonsense!” answered Randolph;
“they were just exchanging a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>little of the current coin that is constantly
passing in gay society. Young Radlet is
not a green-horn. They understand their
game perfectly.”</p>

<p>“She does, of course—no one better;
but it’s a question if he does.”</p>

<p>“Well, he’s a greater fool than he looks,
if he does not!” answered Randolph.
“Does he expect a girl like Beatrice
Wentworth to be enslaved by his charms in
the course of a few hours? The thing’s a
manifest absurdity!”</p>

<p>“Possibly; but that woman can make a
man think anything.”</p>

<p>Randolph looked at his friend with some
attention.</p>

<p>“You seem to have formed very
exhaustive conclusions about Lady Beatrice
Wentworth.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>
<p>It almost seemed as if Tom coloured a
little as he turned impatiently away.</p>

<p>Next day Beatrice seemed to have regained
her usual even flow of spirits. She
met Tom at breakfast as she would meet
any guest under the same roof, and neither
courted nor avoided him in any way. He
seemed to take his cue from her; but his
face still wore the thin-lipped cynical
expression that betrayed a certain amount
of subdued irritation. However, sport was
the all-prevailing topic of the hour, and as
soon as breakfast was concluded, the men
departed, with the dogs and keepers in
their wake.</p>

<p>“What would you like to do, Beatrice?”
asked Monica when the sportsmen had
disappeared. “We have the whole day
before us.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>
<p>“Like to do? Why, everything must
be delightful in this lovely out-of-the-world
place. Monica, no wonder you are
just yourself—not one bit like any
one else—brought up here with only
the sea, and the clouds, and the sunshine
for companions and playmates. I
used to look at you in a sort of wonder,
but I understand it all now. You ought
always to live at Trevlyn—never anywhere
else. What should I like to do? Why,
anything. Suppose we ride. I should
love to gallop along the cliffs with you. I
want to see the queer little church Haddon
described to me, where you were married,
and the picturesque little town where—where
Randolph and he put up on the
eve of that day. I want to see everything
that belongs to your past life,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>Monica. It interests me more than I can
express.”</p>

<p>Monica smiled in her tranquil fashion.</p>

<p>“Very well; you shall gratify your wish.
I will order the horses at once. If we go
to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Maws, I ought to go and see Aunt
Elizabeth—Mrs. Pendrill that is, aunt to
Arthur, and to Tom Pendrill and his
brother. She is sure to want us to stay to
luncheon with her if we do. She will be
all alone; Tom here, and Raymond on his
rounds. Would you dislike that, Beatrice?
She is a sweet old lady, and seems more a
part of my past life than anything else I
can show you, though I could not perhaps
explain why.”</p>

<p>A curious light shone in Beatrice’s eyes.</p>

<p>“Dislike it! I should like it above
everything. I love old ladies. They are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>so much more interesting than young ones,
I often wish I were old myself—not middle-aged,
you know, but really old, <em>very</em> old,
with lovely white hair, and a waxen face all
over tiny wrinkles, like my own grandmother—the
most beautiful woman without
exception that I ever saw. Yes, Monica,
let us do that. It will be delightful. Why
did you never mention the Pendrills to me
before?”</p>

<p>She put the question with studied carelessness.
Yet Monica was certain it was
asked with effort.</p>

<p>“Did I not? I thought I used to tell
you so much about my past life.”</p>

<p>“So you did; but I never heard that
name.”</p>

<p>“You knew Arthur was a Pendrill.”</p>

<p>“Indeed I did not. He was always
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>Arthur to you. I wonder I never asked
his surname; but somehow I never did.
I had a vague idea that some such people
as these Pendrills existed; but I never
heard you name them.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you heard, and forgot it?”
suggested Monica tentatively.</p>

<p>“That I am sure I never did,” was the
very emphatic answer.</p>

<p>Beatrice was delighted with her
morning’s ride. It was a beautiful autumn
day, and everything was looking its best.
The sea flashed and sparkled in the sunlight;
the sky was clear and soft above
them, the horses, delighted to feel the soft
turf beneath their feet, pranced and
curvetted and galloped, with that easy
elastic motion that is so peculiarly
exhilarating.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>
<p>The girl herself looked peculiarly and
vividly beautiful, and Monica was not
surprised at the affectionate interest Mrs.
Pendrill evinced in her from the first
moment of introduction.</p>

<p>But she was a little surprised at the
peculiar sweetness of Beatrice’s demeanour
towards the old lady. Whilst retaining all
her arch brightness and vivacity, the girl
managed to infuse into her manner, her
voice, and her words something gentle
and deferential and winning that was
inexplicably fascinating; all the more so
from its evident unconscious sincerity.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pendrill was charmed with the
beauty and sweetness of the girl, and it
seemed as if Beatrice on her side was equally
fascinated. When the time came to say
good-bye, and the old lady held both her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>hands, and gazed into her bright face, as
she asked for another visit very soon, she
stooped suddenly, and kissed her with
pretty, spontaneous warmth.</p>

<p>“Come again! Of course I will, as often
as Monica will bring me. Good-bye, Mrs.
Pendrill—Aunt Elizabeth I should <em>like</em> to
say”—with a little rippling laugh. “I think
you are just fit to be Monica’s ‘Saint
Elizabeth.’ Is it the air of this place that
makes you all so perfectly delightful? I
shall have to come and live here too, I
think.”</p>

<p>And as she and Monica rode home
together over the sweeping downs, Beatrice
turned to her after a long pause of silence
and said:</p>

<p>“Monica, it was a dangerous experiment
asking me to Trevlyn.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>
<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Because I don’t feel as if I should ever
want to leave it again. And I’m a dreadful
sort of creature when I’m bent on my own
way.”</p>

<p>Monica smiled.</p>

<p>“You will have to turn me out neck and
crop in the end, I firmly believe. I feel I
should just take root here, and never wish
to go.”</p>

<p>Monica shook her head with a look of
subdued amusement.</p>

<p>“I am very glad it pleases you so much;
but do you know, Beatrice, I think you
will have a different tale to tell in a week
or two? You cannot realise, till you have
tried it, how solitary and isolated we are,
especially as the winter draws on. Very
soon you will think it is a dreadfully lonely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>place—a sort of enchanted castle, as
Randolph used to call it; and you will be
pining to get back to the gay, busy whirl
of life, that you have left behind.”</p>

<p>Monica stopped short there struck by
the strange look turned upon her by her
companion. Beatrice’s face had grown
grave and almost pale. A curious wistful
sadness shone in her eyes; it almost seemed
as if tears glistened on the long lashes.</p>

<p>Her words were almost as enigmatical
as her looks.</p>

<p>She gazed at Monica for a moment
speechlessly, and then softly murmured:</p>

<p>“Et tu Brute!”</p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
